And yet we are a sleep-sick society, ignorant of the facts of sleep -- and the price of sleep deprivation. Dr. William Dement, founder and director of the Stanford University Sleep Research Center, takes us on a fascinating tour of the sleeping body and mind, revealing the price we pay for ignoring sleep -- an epidemic of heart disease, 33 percent of traffic-fatigue-related accidents and immeasurable mental and psychological disadvantages.\n\nDr. Dement offers a hands-on prescription for vibrant good health and longevity, including: self-tests to determine how much sleep you really need; information on the role of prescription and over-the-counter sleeping aids; the latest research on how sleep affects the immune system; how to combat insomnia, snoring, jet-lag; and much more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be04b73451cd34331571fffcabea06d4faf9a2a4","amp;dn":"The+Promise+of+Sleep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be04b73451cd34331571fffcabea06d4faf9a2a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,4,183,52,81,205,52,51,21,113,255,252,171,234,6,212,250,249,162,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

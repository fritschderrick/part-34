The result? Razor-sharp, rapid-fire, and raunchy, of course. And beyond hilarious.\n\nFifteen-year-old Matt Gratton and his two best friends, Coop and Sean, always set themselves a summertime goal. This year's? To see a real-live naked girl for the first time Ã¢â‚¬â€ quite a challenge, given that none of the guys has the nerve to even ask a girl out on a date. But catching a girl in the buff starts to look easy compared to Matt's other summertime aspiration: to swim the 100-yard butterfly (the hardest stroke known to God or man) as a way to impress Kelly West, the sizzling new star of the swim team. In the spirit of HollywoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blockbuster comedies, screenwriter-turned-YA-novelist Don Calame unleashes a true ode to the adolescent male: characters who are side-splittingly funny, sometimes crude, yet always full of heart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0859b11753dee933c272220f7a39f6f8024c0761","amp;dn":"Swim+the+Fly+-+Don+Calame.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0859b11753dee933c272220f7a39f6f8024c0761","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,89,177,23,83,222,233,51,194,114,34,15,122,57,246,248,2,76,7,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

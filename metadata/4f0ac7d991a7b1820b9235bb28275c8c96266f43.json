It was the first single from their \nalbum N.E.W.S. (NorthEastWestSouth). Following their top 10 &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;, \n&quot;When the Lady Smiles&quot; was a U.S. chart disappointment, only reaching #76 on \nThe Billboard Hot 100 chart. With a total of 5 &quot;Hot 100&quot; releases, Golden \nEarring are by far the most successful Dutch band on the international charts.\n\nThe video for this song, shot by Dick Maas, was controversial. In one scene, \na man attempts to rape a nun. This particular scene was quickly removed from \nthe video (the full cut was only shown after midnight). The bold video may \nhave hurt the sales of the single in the New World, although it climbed to \nnumber 3 position in the charts in Canada. In The Netherlands, however, \n&quot;When the Lady Smiles&quot; became Golden Earring's fifth number one. \n(video does not have any logos) \n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_the_Lady_Smiles&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_the_Lady_Smiles&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaBbkaaDH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aaBbkaaDH&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 6800kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Media Length: 00:06:02\n\n\n*I also have a uncensored promo .avi file that i'll post if i find it.\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.

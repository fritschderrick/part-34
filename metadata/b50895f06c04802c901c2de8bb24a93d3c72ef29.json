The single features two live tracks from the 1999 Ed Hunter tour, which featured the band reunited with guitarist Adrian Smith and vocalist Bruce Dickinson. Cover art was by Mark Wilkinson. According to interviews with band members, the song was primarily influenced by the science fiction movie Forbidden Planet. (In addition, the name &quot;Out Of The Silent Planet&quot; is a reference to the 1938 C.S. Lewis science fiction novel by the same title.)\n\nIt's a peculiarity in that despite being one of only 2 singles from the album, this was not played on the majority of the accompanying world tour - only in a few encores in South America.\n\nThe guitar solo in the song is played by Janick Gers.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; (Edited Version)  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:10\n    &quot;Wasted Years&quot; (live - Milano, Italy, 9/23/1999) (Adrian Smith) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:07\n    &quot;Aces High&quot; (live - Madrid, Spain, 9/26/1999) (Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:24","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b50895f06c04802c901c2de8bb24a93d3c72ef29","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Out+Of+The+Silent+Planet+%5BSingle%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b50895f06c04802c901c2de8bb24a93d3c72ef29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,8,149,240,108,4,128,44,144,28,45,232,187,36,169,61,60,114,239,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

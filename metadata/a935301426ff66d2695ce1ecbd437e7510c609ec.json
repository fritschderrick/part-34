Dave Edmunds, armed only with a 1959 Gibson 335 and a 100-watt Marshall stack, cranks through these recognizable blues covers (with one original instrumental) with reckless abandon and gobs of technique. Backup support is handled by bassist John Williams and drummer Bob &quot;Congo&quot; Jones, who do their best to keep up and provide a rhythmic foundation for Edmunds to wail over. Edmunds also handled nearly all the vocals, and as blues singers go, he's merely serviceable, but what makes this album worthwhile is the revved-up guitar playing, especially when Edmunds shreds both Freddy King's &quot;The Stumble&quot; and Willie Dixon's &quot;Wang Dang Doodle.&quot; \n\nTracklist:\n\n\nA1    Stumble   \n\nWritten-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Freddy King*, Sonny Thompson \n    \nA2    3 O' Clock Blues   \n\nWritten-By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ B.B.

The band itself was essentially a showpiece for Edmunds' considerable technical ability on the guitar. Love Sculpture mostly performed blues standards, slightly revved-up, but still largely reverent to the originals, releasing their debut album, Blues Helping with such songs as &quot;Summertime&quot;, &quot;Wang Dang Doodle&quot; etc.\n\nThey are best known for their 1968 novelty hit in the UK Singles Chart, a high speed cover version of the classical piece &quot;Sabre Dance&quot;, by Aram Khachaturian, released on the Parlophone label (R 5744), which reached #5 in the UK Singles Chart in December 1968. The recording was inspired by Keith Emerson's classical rearrangements. &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; became a hit after garnering the enthusiastic attention of British DJ John Peel. In December 1968, the UK music magazine, NME, reported that Love Sculpture had signed a U.S. recording contract with London Records, guaranteeing Ã‚Â£250,000. The band were also given an invitation to perform &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; live, on the German Beat-Club television programme of Radio Bremen, being broadcast in monochrome at that time.\n\nThis was followed by a second album Forms and Feelings, with songs including: &quot;In The Land of the Few&quot;, &quot;Farandole&quot;, &quot;People People&quot;, &quot;Seagull (West Coast Oil Tragedy)&quot;, written by Paul Korda, and the equally fast cover of Chuck Berry's &quot;You Can't Catch Me&quot;. The U.S. version of the album also featured a recording of &quot;Mars&quot; from Gustav Holst's The Planets, but Holst's estate refused to license the tune for the U.K. version.\n\nThey recorded three times for BBC Radio 1's John Peel sessions in 1968 (twice) and 1969.\n\nIn 1970 Mickey Gee joined the band as a second guitarist, and Terry Williams replaced Rob Jones on drums.\n\nLove Sculpture split up after a U.S. tour, having recorded two albums. Edmunds shortly went on to further number one hit success with &quot;I Hear You Knocking&quot;, and collaborated heavily with ex-Brinsley Schwarz bassist Nick Lowe, eventually forming the band Rockpile with him.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a935301426ff66d2695ce1ecbd437e7510c609ec","amp;dn":"Blues+Helping-+Love+Sculpture+%281968%29+24bit+96+khz+Vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a935301426ff66d2695ce1ecbd437e7510c609ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,53,48,20,38,255,102,210,105,92,225,236,189,67,126,117,16,198,9,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

I guess the Republicans in Congress expect those people to make ends meet by hoarding candy from last nightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trick-or-treating. Then when the mini-Snickers bars are all gone, the children of poor people can just turn to year-round trick-or-treating. They do that in Third World countries. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s called begging. 15 percent of Americans get food stamps. Conservatives donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think they should. Progressives donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think they should have to.\n\nRepublicans want work requirements for food stamp benefits. Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX) talked about Ã¢â‚¬Å“the dignity of work.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mighty high-falutinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ language coming from a Congress that works a total of about two months a year. Conservatives like to talk about makers and takers. This Congress doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make anything, least of all any laws. All they do is take... take money from lobbyists.\n\nThis is part of their Ã¢â‚¬Å“he who does not work, neither shall he eatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ mantra. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a quoteÃ¢â‚¬â€taken completely out of contextÃ¢â‚¬â€from the Second Book of Thessalonians. They are words to govern by... if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢reÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in charge of governing Thessaly 2,000 years ago. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find a lot of references to making people work for food in the words of Jesus himself. When Jesus did the loaves and fishes miracle, the loaves and fishes were just handed out for free. He didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make his followers pick up trash first.\n\nRush Limbaugh is irate that Obamacare mandates coverage for birth control and breast pumps. Rush obviously would never need birth control. Look at him. Rush Limbaugh IS birth control. Rush adds that he isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a fringe kookÃ¢â‚¬â€he says the people on the left are the fringe kooks. Well, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to get a distorted view when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re as far out on the fringe as Rush is. I wish Rush Limbaugh was in the center. With somebody that fat on the fringes, there is always the danger that the whole thing will tip over.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d8929589c0cccafdc403fd1d7ba107742d99cc6","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+November+01+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d8929589c0cccafdc403fd1d7ba107742d99cc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,137,41,88,156,12,204,175,220,64,63,209,215,186,16,119,66,217,156,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

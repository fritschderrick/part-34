The other songs from that time like &quot;Workout Stevie, Workout&quot; try to capture that explosiveness, but don't manage to find it. As he got older and matured, so did his music and the songs started to show off his immense talents. \n&quot;Uptight&quot; is a pure classic as is &quot;I Was Made To Love Her&quot;. He also started to develop and show a social conscious side with the brilliant &quot;A Place In The Sun&quot; and he takes Bob Dylan's folk anthem &quot;Blowin' In The Wind&quot; and turns it into a call and response, gospel flavored number.

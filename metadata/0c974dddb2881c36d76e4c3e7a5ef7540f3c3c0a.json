Mystery surrounds the movie, and as Sandy learns of the tragedies which haunted its production, she finds herself threatened by an ancient force protecting secrets deeper than the suppression of a 50-year-old movie.\n\nGhosts Know by Ramsey Campbell\nGhosts Know is a fascinating exploration of the twists and turns of reality-media personalities, the line between the dead and the livingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and how the truth can be twisted to serve all manner of reality.\nGraham Wilde is a contentious, bombastic host of the talk radio program Wilde Card. His job, as he sees it, is to stir the pot, and he is quite good at it, provoking many a heated call with his eccentric and often irrational audience. He invites Frank Jasper, a purported psychic, to come on the program. He firmly believes that the man is a charlatan, albeit a talented one. When Jasper appears on his show, Wilde draws upon personal knowledge about the man to embarrass him on air, using patter similar to that which Jasper utilizes in his act.\nWilde's attack on Jasper earns him the enmity of his guest and some of the members of his audience. He next encounters Jasper when the psychic is hired by the family of a missing adolescent girl to help them find her. Wilde is stunned and then horrified when Jasper seems to suggest that he might be behind the girl's disappearance.\nThus begins a nightmarish journey as circumstantial evidence against Wilde begins to mount, alienating his listeners, the radio station, and eventually, his lover. As Wilde descends into a pit of despair, reality and fantasy begin to blur in a kaleidoscope of terrorÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.\nAt the publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management software (DRM) applied.\n\nThe Overnight by Ramsey Campbell \nA bookstore can be a wonderful, welcoming place of both commerce and curiosity. That's the goal for Woody, an American recently transferred to England to run a branch of Texts. He wants a clean, orderly store and lots of sales to show his bosses when they arrive from the States for a pre-Christmas inspection. Not easy given the shop's location in a foggy strip mall.\nAnd things keep going wrong. No matter how often the shelves are put in order before the doors are locked at night, when the staff returns in the morning, books are lying all over the floor, many damp and damaged beyond repair. The store's computers keep acting up-errors appear in brochures and ads and orders disappear completely. And even when the machines are turned off, they seem to glow with a spectral gray light.\nThe hit-and-run death of an employee in the store's parking lot marks a turning point. One employee accuses another of making sexual advances and they come to blows. Between one sentence and the next, one loses his ability to read. The security monitors display half-seen things crawling between the stacks that vanish before anyone can find them.\nDesperate, Woody musters his staff for an overnight inventory. When the last customers reluctantly depart, leaving almost-visible trails of slime shining behind them, the doors are locked, sealing Woody and the others inside for a final orgy of shelving. \nThe damp, grey, silent things that have been lurking in the basement and hiding in the fog may move slowly, but they are inexorable. This bookstore is no haven. It is the doorway to a hell unlike any other. \n\nThe Count Of Eleven by Ramsey Campbell \nJack Orchard seems a normal family man - apart, perhaps from his excessive interest in numerology. When he gets into deep trouble, both he and his wife seem close to cracking. Then, by chance, he receives a chain letter promising good fortune, but things get even worse.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c974dddb2881c36d76e4c3e7a5ef7540f3c3c0a","amp;dn":"4+books+by+Ramsey+Campbell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c974dddb2881c36d76e4c3e7a5ef7540f3c3c0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,151,77,221,178,136,28,54,215,110,76,62,122,94,247,84,15,60,60,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

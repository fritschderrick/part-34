When that film is written and directed by a first-time director, it's even better, because you know you've just been witness to the start of a film career that promises to be something special.  French novelist-turned-director Phillipe Claudel's much-talked about first-time effort, I've Loved You So Long, is one of those films.\nIn the opening sequence without a single word of dialogue to enlighten us as to what's wrong with the main character, we know that this is a woman who has suffered some horrific trauma; she is lost to herself, locked away, not there.  And that's as much as you're going to get out of me as to the plot of this film, because you simply have to see it yourself to appreciate the masterful way in which Claudel weaves this story together.\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068649/\nIMDB Rating: 7.8/10 (2,100 Votes)\nLanguage: French with (good) English subtitles\nRuntime: 115 Minutes\n\nWon the 2009 BAFTA (UK) award in the category ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Best Film Not in the English LanguageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.

These are VobSub subtitles which are a type of image file - each phrase is actually an image of the English words which is superimposed on the video picture.      Most computer players and dvd converters of .avi video do not recognize the VobSub format at all.     For .Avi video especially the preferred formant for English (or other language) subtitles is SRT. It is completely different than VobSub in that SRT is a file of (time-synced) streaming text that streams along with the video in much the same way the sound file streams along with the video file.   I have the software to do the long and complex process of converting IDX/SUB files to SRT files for subtitles. It involves OCR (optical character recognition) and re-syncing.    When I have done it for a torrent it is marked as (Good English subtitles).\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦..\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:762860e10be408379471e11f43f1e081f37c8601","amp;dn":"I%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%84%A2ve+Loved+You+So+Long.2008.Avi+%28Good+English+subtitles%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"762860e10be408379471e11f43f1e081f37c8601","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,40,96,225,11,228,8,55,148,113,225,31,67,241,224,129,243,124,134,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

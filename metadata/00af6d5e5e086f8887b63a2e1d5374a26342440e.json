It seems impossible because.. if robots can break those laws, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing to stop them from taking over the world, as humans have grown to become completely dependent upon their robots. Or maybeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ they already have? Aiding Spooner in his investigation is a psychologist, Dr. Susan Calvin, who specializes in the psyches of robots.\n\nInfo: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343818/\nRelease Date: 16 July 2004 (USA)\nGenre: Action | Mystery | Sci-Fi\nStars: Will Smith, Bridget Moynahan, Bruce Greenwood\nQuality: BluRay 720p\nEncoder: FatNanda@Ganool\nSource: 720p.BluRay.DTS.x264-HiDt\nSize: 750MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00af6d5e5e086f8887b63a2e1d5374a26342440e","amp;dn":"I%2C+Robot+%282004%29+BluRay+720p+750MB+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00af6d5e5e086f8887b63a2e1d5374a26342440e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,175,109,94,94,8,111,136,135,182,58,46,29,83,116,162,99,66,68,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

He spent a year at Harvard University at the Nieman fellowship program for journalists, was a fellow at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts, and has won numerous journalism awards. William Dietrich's books have been hailed for their vivid imagery, evocative atmospheres, impeccable historical accuracy, and ambitious plots. What readers have come to expect from the masterful Dietrich is fast-paced adventure, uncanny wit, and page-turning historical excitement, and he delivers.\nDietrich is married and lives in Anacortes, WA.\n\nThis series contains these books:\n-Napoleon's Pyramids\n-The Rosetta Key\n-The Dakota Cipher\n-The Barbary Pirates\n-The Emerald Storm\n\n\n\nNapoleon's Pyramids: What mystical secrets lie beneath the Great Pyramids? Traveling with Napoleon's ambitious expedition, American adventurer Ethan Gage solves a five-thousand-year-old riddle with the help of a mysterious medallion. \nEthan Gage, assistant to Ben Franklin and expatriate American in post-revolutionary France, wins an ancientÃ¢â‚¬â€and possibly cursedÃ¢â‚¬â€medallion in a card game one night. It turns out that the medallion, covered in seemingly indecipherable symbols, may be linked to a Masonic mystery. That same night, however, Ethan is framed for a prostitute's murder and barely escapes France with his life. \n\nThe Rosetta Key: Gage finds himself hurled into the Holy Land in dogged pursuit of an ancient Egyptian scroll imbued with magic, even as Bonaparte launches his 1799 invasion of Israel, which will climax at the epic siege of Acre. Pursuing Napoleon to France, where the general hopes ancient secrets will catapult him to power, the wily and inventive Gage faces old enemies with unlikely new friends, and must use wit, humor, derring-do, and an archaeological key to prevent dark powers from seizing control of the world.\n\nThe Dakota Cipher: Ethan Gage, the hero of Napoleon's Pyramids and The Rosetta Key, just wants to enjoy the fruits of victory after helping Napoleon win the Battle of Marengo and end an undeclared naval war with the United States. But a foolish tryst with Bonaparte's married sister and the improbable schemes of a grizzled Norwegian named Magnus Bloodhammer soon send Ethan on a new treasure hunt on America's frontier that will have him dodging scheming aristocrats and hostile Indians. \n\nThe Barbary Pirates: During the roiling era of Napoleon's reign, American adventurer Ethan Gage is in a desperate race with the Barbary pirates - and with his Egyptian Rite nemesis Aurora Somerset - to rediscover and control the mirror of Archimedes: an ancient super-weapon that legend contends burned a Roman fleet. In 1802, this death ray could tip the balance of power in the Mediterranean, and Ethan must stop the pirates from using it against American, English, and French fleets. Beginning in Paris, the dashing Gage, with the help of real-life scientists and engineers, must not only rescue his former lover Astiza; he must also save the three-year-old son he didn't know he had. Astiza and Gage's enemy, Aurora, find themselves in a fight to the death, while the infant United States Navy tests its mettle against Tripoli.\n\nThe Emerald Storm: In the fifth installment of master storyteller William Dietrich's bestselling adventure series, the swashbuckling, battle-scarred hero Ethan Gage must race from the slopes of the Alps to the sultry tropics of the Caribbean to pursue a mysterious Spanish treasure as the fate of England - and of the world's first successful slave revolt - hang desperately in the balance. The Emerald Storm is the action-packed historical masterpiece that Ethan Gage fans have long awaited. Fans of the Indiana Jones adventures, the Sharpe's Rifles series, and the thrilling works of James Rollins, who himself calls Dietrich's writing 'adventure at its grandest,' will find The Emerald Storm a satisfying, sword-in-hand romp through history - and new readers will discover it as the perfect introduction to the breathtaking Ethan Gage Adventures.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c379cf9e9abbc58a1c9bb2351a96bb0ab8cd65a0","amp;dn":"Ethan+Gage+Series+by+William+Dietrich+%5BEPUB%5D+%5BMOBI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c379cf9e9abbc58a1c9bb2351a96bb0ab8cd65a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,121,207,158,154,187,197,138,28,155,178,53,26,150,187,10,184,205,101,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

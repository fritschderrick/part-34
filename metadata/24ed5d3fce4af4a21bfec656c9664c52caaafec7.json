A co-production between the BBC and the Open University, the series looks at the impact the World Wide Web has had since its inception 20 years ago. The series took on a different approach to BBC documentary making by encouraging an open and collaborative production.\n\nPart 1: The Great Levelling\nIn the first in this four-part series, Aleks charts the extraordinary rise of blogs, Wikipedia andand traces an ongoing clash between the freedom the technology offers us, and our innate human desire to control and profit. Dr Aleks Krotoski looks at how it is reshaping almost every aspect of our lives. Joined by some of the webÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s biggest names ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including the founders of Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, and the webÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inventor ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ she explores how far the web has lived up to its early promise.\n\nPart 2: Enemy of the State\nHere, Aleks charts how the Web is forging a new brand of politics, both in democracies and authoritarian regimes. With contributions from Al Gore, Martha Lane Fox, Stephen Fry and Bill Gates, Aleks explores how interactive, unmediated sites like Twitter andhave encouraged direct action and politicised young people in unprecedented numbers. Yet, at the same time, the WebÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s openness enables hardline states to spy and censor, and extremists to threaten with networks of hate and crippling cyber attacks.\n\nPart 3: The Cost of Free\nIn the third programme of the series, Aleks gives the lowdown on how, for better and for worse, commerce has colonised the web ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and reveals how web users are paying for what appear to be ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“freeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sites and services in hidden ways. Joined by some of the most influential business leaders of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s web, including Jeff Bezos (CEO of Amazon), Eric Schmidt (CEO of Google), Chad Hurley (CEO ofBill Gates, Martha Lane Fox and Reed Hastings (CEO of Netflix), Aleks traces how business, with varying degrees of success, has attempted to make money on the web.\n\nPart 4: Homo Interneticus\nDr Aleks Krotoski concludes her investigation of how the World Wide Web is transforming almost every aspect of our lives. Joined by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Al Gore and the neuroscientist Susan Greenfield, Aleks examines the popularity of social networks such as Facebook and asks how they are changing our relationships. And, in a ground-breaking test at University College London, Aleks investigates how the Web may be distracting and overloading our brains.\n\nTechnical Specs for Hi-Def\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1280 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ 720\nAudio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kb/s 48000Hz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 1.73GB\nRipped by JungleBoy\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVB-S","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24ed5d3fce4af4a21bfec656c9664c52caaafec7","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Virtual+Revolution+Episodes+1-4+HDTV+x264+AC3+720p-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24ed5d3fce4af4a21bfec656c9664c52caaafec7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,237,93,63,206,74,244,162,27,254,198,86,201,102,76,82,202,170,254,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

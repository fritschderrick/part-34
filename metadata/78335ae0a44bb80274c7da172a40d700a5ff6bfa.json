For reasons that are unclear even to those who watch the film, the last specimen of the experiment (BUD the C.H.U.D.) is hidden away in a Centre for Disease Control in a small American town, where a trio of bumbling teenagers accidentally steal and reawaken him. Bud escapes and begins to forge an army of C.H.U.D.s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78335ae0a44bb80274c7da172a40d700a5ff6bfa","amp;dn":"C.H.U.D.+II+Bud+The+Chud.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78335ae0a44bb80274c7da172a40d700a5ff6bfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,51,90,224,164,75,184,2,116,199,218,23,42,64,215,0,165,255,107,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

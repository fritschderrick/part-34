At the heart of the novel is Giovanna, whose family is targeted by the notorious Black Hand -the precursor to the Mafia. Elizabeth Street brings to light a period in history when Italian immigrant neighborhoods lived in fear of Black Hand extortion and violence-a reality that defies the romanticized depiction of the Mafia. Here, the author reveals the merciless terror of the Black Hand-and the impact their crimes had on her family. Giovanna is based on Fabiano's great-grandmother, and the book's heroes and villains - such as Lieutenant Petrosino, the crusading cop and Lupo the Wolf, a cold-blooded criminal - are drawn from real life in this thrilling tale. While set in a dynamic historical context, Elizabeth Street is, above all, the dramatic story of the heroine, Giovanna, and how she triumphed over tragedy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61b637c114fd94f66afb7657e8bc3eb1eb2b61f1","amp;dn":"Laurie+Fabiano+-+Elizabeth+Street","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61b637c114fd94f66afb7657e8bc3eb1eb2b61f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,182,55,193,20,253,148,246,106,251,118,87,232,188,62,177,235,43,97,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Under the noses of British intelligence, London has become the European hub for the promotion, recruitment and financing of Islamic terror and extremism--so much so that it has been mockingly dubbed Londonistan. In this ground-breaking book Melanie Phillips pieces together the story of how Londonistan developed as a result of the collapse of traditional English identity and accommodation of a particularly virulent form of multiculturalism. Londonistan has become a country within the country and not only threatens Britain but its special relationship with the U.S. as well.\n\n&quot;Londonistan is a courageous exposÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© of what is happening in Britain as well as a last minute wake up call for the British to act now before it is too late.&quot;--Isi Leibler, Israeli Insider\n\n&quot;Londonistan ... is an eloquent warning of the dangers of 'multicultural paralysis' and appeasing what Miss Phillips calls &quot;clerical fascism.&quot;--Washington Times\n\nAuthor: Melanie Phillips\nPublisher: Encounter Books; Revised edition\nPublication Date: June 25, 2007\n\nFormats:\n.epub (compatable with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n.mobi (compatable with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d25a21686ee53e8b33f3d4ad9603f487d1363403","amp;dn":"Melanie+Phillips+-+Londonistan+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d25a21686ee53e8b33f3d4ad9603f487d1363403","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,90,33,104,110,229,62,139,51,243,212,173,150,3,244,135,209,54,52,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Meanwhile, Becky, a park ranger with a harrowing past, finds solace amid the lyrical beauty of the North Carolina mountains.\r\n\r\nEnduring the mistakes and tragedies that have indelibly marked them, they are drawn together by a reverence for the natural world. When an embittered elderly local is accused of poisoning a trout stream on the property of a nearby resort, Les and Becky are plunged into deep and dangerous waters, forced to navigate currents of disillusionment and betrayal that will force them to question themselves and test their tentative bondâ€”and threaten to carry them over the edge.\r\n\r\nEchoing the lapsarian beauty of William Faulkner and the spiritual isolation of Carson McCullers, Above the Waterfall demonstrates the prodigious talent of an author hailed as &quot;a gorgeous, brutal writer&quot; (Richard Price) and &quot;one of the best American novelists of his day&quot; (Janet Maslin, New York Times). Unforgettable and evocative, tragic and indelible, Above the Waterfall is a breathtaking achievement from a literary virtuoso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cae1f2f6fcb85356d2a68dfd4ed1a8917017e80","amp;dn":"Ron+Rash+-+Above+the+Waterfall+%28retail%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cae1f2f6fcb85356d2a68dfd4ed1a8917017e80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,174,31,47,111,203,133,53,109,42,104,223,212,237,26,137,23,1,126,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

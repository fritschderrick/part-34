The difference is that while the Boredoms concentrate on deconstructing music into ridiculousness, Zoobombs plow through intense rock songs with a serious Bo Diddley influence. The result is something like the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's best work -- old-fashioned rock is revved up and taken to its extremes to produce a wholly modern sound. Welcome Back, Zoobombs throws this together with hip-hop beats, organ-driven rock-outs, and production that captures the raw intensity of the band -- and the result is pretty difficult not to like.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2bf380f75227a5f2ca7909d1d1100f80ed694d1","amp;dn":"Zoobombs+-+Welcome+Back%2C+Zoobombs%21+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2bf380f75227a5f2ca7909d1d1100f80ed694d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,191,56,15,117,34,122,95,44,167,144,157,29,17,0,248,14,214,148,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

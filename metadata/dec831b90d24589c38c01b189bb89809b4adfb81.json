Afterwards, Ben invites the gang to his home town of Oakhaven in New England. But when they arrive, they find that the town has been built up by Mayor Corey into a tourist attraction, complete with a replica of the town in the 17th century and the supposed ghost of a witch who haunts the town. Mayor Corey and pharmacist Mr. McKnight explain that the ghost is Sarah Ravencroft, a relative of Ben's, who was persecuted as a witch by the town in 1657. But Ben says that Sarah was actually a Wiccan who used natural herbs to heal people, and even has a diary of all her patients that Ben wants to find to prove her innocence. Scooby and Shaggy find what appears to be a shoe buckle, and then go to a local diner for food, owned by the friendly Jack.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196931/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196931/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIll be back to seed tomorrow","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dec831b90d24589c38c01b189bb89809b4adfb81","amp;dn":"Scooby-Doo+and+the+Witch%5C%27s+Ghost+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dec831b90d24589c38c01b189bb89809b4adfb81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,200,49,185,13,36,88,156,56,192,27,24,155,184,152,9,180,173,251,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

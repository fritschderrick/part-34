In the aftermath of that war, John of Patmos, a Jewish\nprophet and follower of Jesus, wrote the Book of Revelation, prophesying Gods judgment\non the pagan empire that devastated and dominated his people. Soon after, Christians fearing\narrest and execution championed Johns prophecies as offering hope for deliverance from\nevil. Others seized on the Book of Revelation as a weapon against heretics and infidels\nof all kinds.\n     Even after Johns prophecies seemed disprovenÃ¢â‚¬â€instead of being destroyed, Rome\nbecame a Christian empireÃ¢â‚¬â€those who loved Johns visions refused to discard them and\ninstead reinterpreted themÃ¢â‚¬â€as Christians have done for two thousand years. Brilliantly\nweaving scholarship with a deep understanding of the human needs to which religion speaks,\nPagels has written what may be the masterwork in her unique career. \n\nAuthor: Elaine Pagels\nTitle: Revelations: Visions, Prophecy, and Politics in the Book of Revelation\nPublisher: Random House Audio\nYear: 2012\nISBN-10: 0307988260\nISBN-13: 9780307988263\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!

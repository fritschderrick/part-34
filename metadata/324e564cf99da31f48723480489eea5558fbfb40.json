First published as a book in 1883, it was originally serialised in the children's magazine Young Folks between 1881-82 under the title The Sea Cook, or Treasure Island.\n\n\nTraditionally considered a coming of age story, it is an adventure tale known for its superb atmosphere, character and action, and also a wry commentary on the ambiguity of moralityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as seen in Long John SilverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½unusual for children's literature then and now. It is one of the most frequently dramatised of all novels. The influence of Treasure Island on popular perception of pirates is vast, including treasure maps with an &quot;X&quot;, schooners, the Black Spot, tropical islands, and one-legged seamen with parrots on their shoulders.\n\n\nIf you haven't gotten around to this book then its well worth listening to this.\n\n\nEnjoy and please seed this as much as you can so others can enjoy as well.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:324e564cf99da31f48723480489eea5558fbfb40","amp;dn":"TREASURE+ISLAND+by+Robert+Louis+Stevenso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"324e564cf99da31f48723480489eea5558fbfb40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,78,86,76,249,157,163,31,72,114,52,128,72,158,234,85,88,251,251,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

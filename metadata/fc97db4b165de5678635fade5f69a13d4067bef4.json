It was released on October 8, 1991. The album is a &quot;best of&quot; from the 42 concerts Eric Clapton did at the Royal Albert Hall in those two years. Clapton set a new record by playing a run of 24 nights at the London Royal Albert Hall between February 5 and March 9, 1991, following an 18-night run in 1990. Clapton reportedly was not satisfied with the 1990 concert recordings and delayed the release of a CD until after the &quot;24 Nights&quot; of the 1991 dates.[3] These concerts were performed with 4 different instrumental formations, 4-piece, blues, 9-piece and orchestra nights, the last featuring the National Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Michael Kamen..\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Badge\n[02] Running On Faith\n[03] White Room\n[04] Sunshine Of Your Love\n[05] Watch Yourself\n[06] Have You Ever Loved A Woman\n[07] Worried Life Blues\n[08] Hoodoo Man\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 00h:52m:38s\n\nCD-02 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Pretending\n[02] Bad Love\n[03] Old Love\n[04] Wonderful Tonight\n[05] Bell Bottom Blues\n[06] Hard Times\n[07] Edge Of Darkness\n\nCD-02 Play Time - 00h:52m:36s\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 01h:45m:14s\nTotal File Size....................... 254mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................

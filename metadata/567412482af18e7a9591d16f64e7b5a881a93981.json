The topics describe clever DSP tricks of the trade not covered in conventional DSP textbooks. This material is practical, real-world, DSP tips and tricks as opposed to the traditional highly-specialized, math-intensive, research subjects directed at industry researchers and university professors. This book goes well beyond the standard DSP fundamentals textbook and presents new, but tried-and-true, clever implementations of digital filter design, spectrum analysis, signal generation, high-speed function approximation, and various other DSP functions.\n\nCONTENTS: 46 chapters; see Wiley website above.\n\nFILE INFO: paginated, bookmarked, true PDF.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:567412482af18e7a9591d16f64e7b5a881a93981","amp;dn":"Digital+Signal+Processing%3A+Understanding+%2B+Streamlining+%28Lyons%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"567412482af18e7a9591d16f64e7b5a881a93981","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,116,18,72,42,241,142,122,149,145,209,111,100,231,181,168,129,169,57,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

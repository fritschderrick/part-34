With host John Larroquette at the helm, the Jupiter 2 takes off for a rollicking ride through the classic series greatest moments -- from the most memorable alien encounters to the funniest outtakes.\n\nLost In Space Forever traces the series evolution from straightforward space age adventure to wildly imaginative camp classic through its current incarnation as a big budget feature with state of the art special effects. There's even a &quot;surprise&quot; reunion with Dr. Smith (Jonathan Harris), Will Robinson (Bill Mumy) and The Robot in an all-new scene from the deck of the Jupiter 2 - completely rebuilt from the original blueprints.\n\nViewers get the inside &quot;scoop&quot; on the show whose three seasons (1965-68) thrilled millions around the world. Interviews with cast members from the series -- as well as the movie -- tell the behind the scenes story of this science fiction phenomenon.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae5b028b3fb5b5f15effb6dacda6436f4ef18c7b","amp;dn":"Lost.In.Space.Forever.1998.DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae5b028b3fb5b5f15effb6dacda6436f4ef18c7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,91,2,139,63,181,181,241,94,255,182,218,205,166,67,111,78,241,140,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

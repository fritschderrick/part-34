What limits are there to toleration? What is required of us if we are to promote a truly tolerant society? These themes--the grounds, limits, and requirements of toleration--are central to this book, which presents the W.B. Morrell Memorial Lectures on Toleration, given in 1986 at the University of York. Covering a wide range of practical and theoretical issues, the contributors--including F.A. Hayek, Maurice Cranston, and Karl Popper--consider the philosophical difficulties inherent in the concept as well as the practical problems of implementing a policy of toleration. Although the contributors differ in their conclusions about the grounds of toleration, they all share a belief in the importance of the concept both historically and in modern society.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cd3040f76696a4e5c0f3c17d138473b2f744043","amp;dn":"on+toleration.susan+mendus+%26amp%3B+david+edwards+eds.1987.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cd3040f76696a4e5c0f3c17d138473b2f744043","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,211,4,15,118,105,106,78,92,15,60,23,209,56,71,59,47,116,64,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

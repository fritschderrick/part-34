ÃƒÂ¢??Stop At NothingÃƒÂ¢?? was second on my 2003 Top Ten due to its superb musicianship and fierce mix of Metal genres. What makes DYING FETUS and ÃƒÂ¢??Stop At NothingÃƒÂ¢?? a band and album entrenched in Death Metal than pure Grindcore is that their songs are longer and far more varied than that of the typical Grind bands like early NAPALM DEATH and CARCASS. To be sure, DYING FETUS plough through tracks like ÃƒÂ¢??One Shot, One KillÃƒÂ¢?? with a range from that blast beat of Grind to Mid-Tempo Death and at times a back and forth riffing of steady, punching Metal that has one swaying your head and waving the Horns!\n\n \n\nDYING FETUS also are a band which defy their moniker by having extremely focused, social centred lyrics instead of the blood and guts one might expect from a band with ÃƒÂ¢??FetusÃƒÂ¢?? in their name. Lyrically DYING FETUS come across with a more hardcore aesthetic, railing against mainstream society and convention. Ultimately though, it is the music I care about. ThatÃƒÂ¢??s why DYING FETUS sit near the top of my favourite contemporary Death Metal acts right now. ThereÃƒÂ¢??s just no bullshit with them. Add to that an ardent clutch on battering music with far more depth than they might be given credit for, you canÃƒÂ¢??t lose. I await DYING FETUSÃƒÂ¢??s new album anxiously but ÃƒÂ¢??Stop At NothingÃƒÂ¢?? is a stellar work to hold me over.&quot; - http://www.metal-observer.com/articles.php?lid=1&amp;sid=1&amp;id=8991\n\nDying Fetus\n\nStop at Nothing - (2003)\n\n1.

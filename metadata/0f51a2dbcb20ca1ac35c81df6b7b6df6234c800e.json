He is probably best remembered for the songs &quot;Time in a Bottle&quot; and &quot;Bad, Bad Leroy Brown,&quot; both #1 hits in 1973.\n\n&quot;Time in a Bottle&quot; was a posthumous #1 hit for singer-songwriter Jim Croce, reaching the top of the charts in December 1973, three months after his death in a plane crash. The song, written for his son A.J. Croce, appeared on his first album in 1972, You Don&amp;#039;t Mess Around with Jim. Croce would subsequently shoot to fame with his summer 1973 hit single &quot;Bad Bad Leroy Brown&quot;, just months before a plane crash on September 20 of that year. Time in a Bottle was later used as the title for a compilation album of Croce&amp;#039;s love songs.\n\nThe song started receiving widespread airplay in the fall of 1973, after it was featured in an ABC (TV) TV movie, She Lives!, that starred Desi Arnaz Jr. and Season Hubley.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f51a2dbcb20ca1ac35c81df6b7b6df6234c800e","amp;dn":"Jim+Croce+-+Time+In+A+Bottle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f51a2dbcb20ca1ac35c81df6b7b6df6234c800e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,81,162,219,203,32,202,26,195,92,129,223,107,123,109,246,35,76,128,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Their style has been \ncharacterised as progressive rock, although their sound \noften explored other genres, incorporating elements of \nstyles such as folk, psychedelia, acid, jazz fusion and \nrock and roll. The band achieved recognition in the \nUnited Kingdom through their albums, club and concert \ntours and appearances at festivals, but were unable to \nattract the same level of attention in USA.\n\nThe band's rotating membership throughout its relatively \nshort existence led to a diversity in sound throughout \ntheir different albums. Family are also often seen as \nan unjustly forgotten act, when compared with other bands \nfrom the same period and have been described as an \n&quot;odd band loved by a small but rabid group of fans\n\nAlbum Title: In Their Own Time [Disc 1/2] \nArtist | Group: Family \nRelease date: 2005 \nGenre: Progressive Rock /Hard Rock \nNumber of track(s): 32 \nFile format: mp3 \nTotal duration: 01h:14m:44s:851ms+01h:05m:15s:904ms \nTotal size: 173.0512 MB+151.376 MB \n\n\n01 - Drowned in wine [4mn 10s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 9.68 MiB ]\n02 - The Cat &amp; The Rat [2mn 32s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 5.93 MiB ]\n03 - A song for me [9mn 17s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 21.4 MiB ]\n04 - Love is a sleeper [4mn 2s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 9.37 MiB ]\n05 - Between blue &amp; me [5mn 2s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 11.6 MiB ]\n06 - Spanish tide [4mn 2s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 9.37 MiB ]\n07 - Children [2mn 19s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 5.44 MiB ]\n08 - Sat d-y Barfly [3mn 58s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 9.23 MiB ]\n09 - Larf &amp; sing [2mn 45s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 6.44 MiB ]\n10 - Take your partners [6mn 23s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 14.8 MiB ]\n11 - Good new bad news [7mn 23s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 17.0 MiB ]\n12 - Strange band [3mn 21s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 7.82 MiB ]\n13 - Part of the load [4mn 40s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 10.8 MiB ]\n14 - Lives &amp; ladies [6mn 33s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 15.1 MiB ]\n15 - Holding the compass [3mn 48s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 8.84 MiB ]\n16 - Willow tree [4mn 22s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 10.1 MiB ]\n\n\n01 - Burlesque [4mn 5s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 9.48 MiB ]\n02 - Broken Nose [4mn 9s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 9.64 MiB ]\n03 - Glove [4mn 50s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 11.2 MiB ]\n04 - My Friend The Sun [4mn 20s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 10.1 MiB ]\n05 - Coronation [3mn 50s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 8.92 MiB ]\n06 - Ready To Go [4mn 37s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 10.7 MiB ]\n07 - It's Only A Movie [5mn 8s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 11.9 MiB ]\n08 - Buffet Tea For Two [5mn 21s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 12.4 MiB ]\n09 - Sweet Desiree [3mn 40s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 8.54 MiB ]\n10 - Check Out [4mn 30s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 10.4 MiB ]\n11 - Boom Bang [3mn 2s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 7.08 MiB ]\n12 - Boots 'n' Roots [5mn 1s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 11.6 MiB ]\n13 - In My Own Time [3mn 34s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 8.32 MiB ]\n14 - Seasons [2mn 22s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 5.57 MiB ]\n15 - No Mules Fool [3mn 10s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 7.39 MiB ]\n16 - Good Friend Of Mine [3mn 31s ][ 320 Kbps ][ CBR ][ 8.18 MiB ]\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8816a3a6eff1d6294310d96a64d933fd7c27c3ac","amp;dn":"Family+-+In+Their+Own+Time+2005+%5BMP3%40320%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8816a3a6eff1d6294310d96a64d933fd7c27c3ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,22,163,166,239,241,214,41,67,16,217,106,100,217,51,253,124,39,195,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

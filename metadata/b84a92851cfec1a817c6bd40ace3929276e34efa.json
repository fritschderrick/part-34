The story\nfocuses on the adventures of Yoshihiko, a young\nman who sets forth on a journey to save his\nvillage from a deadly plague, and the companions\nthat join him on the way to the eponymous Demon\nKingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Castle.\n\nTouting itself as &quot;A no-budget action-adventure\nseries&quot;, Yoshihiko is an officially sanctioned\nlove letter to SquareEnixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dragon Quest series,\nwith a great attention to detail and to the common\nJRPG tropes. Dragon Quest fans should easily\nrecognize all these nods on this first episode,\ndown to the HeroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clothes (taken straight from\nDQV), the monsters, the battle sounds, etc. The\nshow also features several cameos from japanese tv\nstars and manzai duos (which might be where most\nof the budget went to).\n\nThese following episodes will be brought to you by\nthe lovely KouAidou and Lynxara, who took a break\nfrom their busy schedule to work on this silly\nshow. We hope you enjoy them as much as we do!\n\n[CODEC INFO]\nStream 0\n\tType: Video\n\tCodec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part 10) (avc1)\n\tResolution: 1280x720\n\tFrame rate: 29.970628\n\tDecoded format: Planar 4:2:0 YUV\n\nStream 1\n\tType: Audio\n\tCodec: MPEG AAC Audio (mp4a)\n\tChannels: Stereo\n\tSample rate: 48000 Hz\n\nStream 2\n\tType: Subtitle\n\tCodec: Substation Alpha subtitles (ssa )\n\n\n[INFO S2]\nSo here we are again, with a New Game+ (and\nseason) of The Hero Yoshihiko! The last time we\nsaw our heroes, they were off to a new journey,\ntheir paths divided by fate. This time, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got\n11 episodes worth of low-budget adventures\nscheduled, and while the creators may claim they\ndidnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t up the budget a tiny bit, we know better.\nWith that OP, the season should be looking fuglier\nthan usual but it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t!\n\nOnce again, huge thanks to Kou and Lynxara for\nmaking this release possible. May their infinite\nwit and wisdom make this show more enjoyable to\nyou.\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll notice thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a crossed-out link for the\nnotes. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be non-crossed out sometime this\nweekend. God knows IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m gonna take ages typing them\nout, so bear with me a liÃ¢â‚¬â„¢l bit longer! There\nshould be some hidden inside the script, if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re\ndying to find out about some japanese jokes.\n\nIn the meantime, there is one thing you should\nknow: starting from this episode weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be\ncorrecting the wizardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spelling from Melub to\nMereb, to match whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on the new OP. The incoming\nbatch of S1 will have v2s with this correction.\n\nAnother thing you should know: we actually got\ncaps for this whole season. This means weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be\nencoding Yoshihiko in 10bit just like the Super\nHero Time weeklies. If you really need 720p 8bit\nYoshihiko encodes, there should be some at\nD-Addicts. The raws are cut similarly, so the .ass\nfiles should match them closely at least. I think.\nMaybe. Somebody should check that out!\n\n[SOURCE]\nThey will be uploading subbed versions over at\n[Over-Time] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://over-ti.me/releases/the-hero-yoshihiko-and-the-key-of-evil-spirits-01/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://over-ti.me/releases/the-hero-yoshihiko-and-the-key-of-evil-spirits-01/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[CODEC INFO]\nStream 0\n\tType: Video\n\tCodec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part 10) (avc1)\n\tResolution: 1280x720\n\tFrame rate: 47.952047\n\tDecoded format: Planar 4:2:0 YUV 10-bit LE\n\nStream 1\n\tType: Audio\n\tCodec: MPEG AAC Audio (mp4a)\n\tChannels: Stereo\n\tSample rate: 48000 Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b84a92851cfec1a817c6bd40ace3929276e34efa","amp;dn":"%5BOver-Time%5D+%5BLinkaans%5D+The+Hero+Yoshihiko+Season+1%26amp%3B2+%28s1+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b84a92851cfec1a817c6bd40ace3929276e34efa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,74,146,133,28,254,193,168,23,198,189,64,172,227,146,146,118,227,78,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

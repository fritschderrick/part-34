Whitehouse (CRC, 2011).pdf\r\n\r\nSince the publication of the first edition, miniaturization and nanotechnology have become inextricably linked to traditional surface geometry and metrology. This interdependence of scales has had profound practical implications.\r\n\r\nUpdated and expanded to reflect many new developments, Handbook of Surface and Nanometrology, Second Edition determines how the reduction in scale of size from macro to nano has affected all aspects of surface use and measurement. The book discusses how this shift has extended through characterization, standardization, manufacture, and performance. With nanotechnology now permeating the text, this edition covers new methods of production and measurement as well as new performance requirements.\r\n\r\nDescribed as the father of digital metrology by the American Society for Precision Engineering, author David J. Whitehouse explores the range of surface size scalesâ€”macro, micro, nano, atomic, and combinations of these. He examines traditional, structured, patterned, and free-form surfaces, emphasizing the growing need to understand the behavior of multiple surfaces.\r\n\r\nStill the definitive reference in the field, the second edition of this handbook continues to provide in-depth, extensive coverage of the engineering, physics, materials, mathematics, and computing involved in surface metrology and nanometrology. Nothing concerning current surface geometry escapes inclusion or scrutiny in this book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06d3d46abbb963a29cf3b50112bcfda57fd0a7d7","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Surface+and+Nanometrology+2nd+ed+-+David+J.+Whitehou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06d3d46abbb963a29cf3b50112bcfda57fd0a7d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,211,212,106,187,185,99,162,156,243,181,1,18,188,253,165,127,208,167,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

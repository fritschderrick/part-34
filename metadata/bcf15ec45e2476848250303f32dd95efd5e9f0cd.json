The mere presence of foreign soldiers fighting a war in Afghanistan is probably the single most important factor in the resurgence of the Taliban.\n\nAs part of the filmaking process, acclaimed Director Robert Greenwald (Iraq for Sale: The War Profiteers, Outfoxed, Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price) traveled to Afghanistan to meet with and interview members of Afghanistan's parliament, bloggers, women's rights organizations, and groups committed to the peace movement.\n\n&quot; We are going after ethnic Pashtuns who are fighting the central government in Kabul. We are in the middle of a civil-war. We are fighting a civil-war.. We are fighting to build a nation in Afghanistan, a nation that maybe the Afghans don't want. &quot;\n\nIf this film doesn't break your heart, then you haven't one to break.\n\nManhattanites could have been leaping from the burning embers of tradetower-esque buildings all day and night since 9/11, and it wouldn't have added up to the civilian deaths in Afghanistan, or Iraq, or Libya, nor Syria, respectively.\n\nCover &amp; screens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/atvvw6t4/747b53ee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/atvvw6t4/747b53ee&lt;/a&gt;\n\n9/11 THE FALLiNG MAN (DVD5)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8420754/9_11_THE_FALLiNG_MAN_%28DVD5%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8420754/9_11_THE_FALLiNG_MAN_%28DVD5%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmerica Rebuilds (2002)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7427913/America_Rebuilds_%282002%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7427913/America_Rebuilds_%282002%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Loss Of Liberty: The USS Liberty (DVD5)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8422553/The_Loss_Of_Liberty__The_USS_Liberty_%28DVD5%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8422553/The_Loss_Of_Liberty__The_USS_Liberty_%28DVD5%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n (seeds please)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/cockymountainoyster&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/cockymountainoyster&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcf15ec45e2476848250303f32dd95efd5e9f0cd","amp;dn":"Rethink+Afghanistan+%28DVD9%2C+2009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcf15ec45e2476848250303f32dd95efd5e9f0cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,241,94,196,94,36,118,132,130,80,48,63,50,221,149,239,213,233,240,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

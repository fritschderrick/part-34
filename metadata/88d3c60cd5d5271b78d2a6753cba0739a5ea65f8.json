After the death of a friend Kafka decides to investigate the case on his own and ends up uncovering dark secrets hidden deep inside the Castle... Perhaps not the best film by Soderbergh but very interesting nonetheless for its originality, weirdness and excellent cast of actors.\n\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n'If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE'\n\nDo you like really fucked-up, weird flicks?

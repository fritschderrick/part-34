Kuijken.\r\n\r\nGramophone Review\r\nKuijkenâ€™s wonderful simplicity of playing allows these works to speak for themselves\r\nKuijkenâ€™s 1981 analogue recording of the Sonatas and Partitasâ€š on the same labelâ€š was a pioneering achievementâ€š persuading us that this demanding music needs a period instrument for it to have its full effect. The new recordingâ€š using the same Grancino violinâ€š offers very similar interpretations â€“ indeedâ€š the most noticeable difference between the two sets is the recorded sound. In 1981 Kuijken was given a clearâ€š intimate recording; this versionâ€š made in the Accademia Chigiana in Sienaâ€š has a far livelier acousticâ€š and a richer sonority. Fine in the slower movementsâ€š but in fastâ€š intricate pieces like the finales of the first two sonatasâ€š the extra resonance blurs the musicâ€™s impact. Is it because of this spacious ambience that Kuijken now adopts rather more measured tempos? This can be a significant improvement; whereas the earlier account of the First Partitaâ€™s Tempo di Borea seems a touch breathlessâ€š the new performance adds a sense of poiseâ€š with no loss of liveliness. But there are one or two movements â€“ the gigue in Partita No 2 is one â€“ where the more deliberate speed brings a feeling of laboriousness. Kuijkenâ€™s great virtues as a Bach player are his firm grasp of the musicâ€™s characterâ€š particularly its rhythmic characterâ€š and his often intense feeling for the overall shape of each piece. Compared to many Baroque playersâ€š his performances seem very straightforward; the phrases shaped beautifully but without exaggerationâ€š the rubato always subtle. The demands of the music always dominate over technical considerations â€“ there is occasional roughness that isnâ€™t present in Rachel Podgerâ€™s recent accounts. Podgerâ€š indeedâ€š achieves an astonishing degree of clarity and polish. Her recordingâ€š tooâ€š is superior to either of Kuijkenâ€™s â€“ perfect definition yet with an attractive bloom. Her performances are stylish and elegantâ€š full of interest and variety. Yetâ€š ultimatelyâ€š Iâ€™d choose Kuijken as a guide to the music. The Correnta of the First Partita gives a good example of their contrasted styles â€“ Podgerâ€š with vividly varied bowings and lots of little hesitations to mark the phrase breaksâ€š making a capricious and slightly mannered impressionâ€š Kuijken much simplerâ€š yet alive to everything in the music that promotes its spiritedâ€š dancing character","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:245cbc4ea845f04aebe5845b8a276e975cd232b1","amp;dn":"Bach+-+Sonatas+and+Partitas+%282001%29+%5BFLAC%5D+%28Sigiswald+Kuijken%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"245cbc4ea845f04aebe5845b8a276e975cd232b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,92,188,78,168,69,240,74,235,229,132,91,138,39,110,151,92,210,50,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

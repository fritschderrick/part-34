Provide labor, materials, equipment and services, and perform operations required for complete installation of the Pre-insulated Ductwork and related work as indicated on the drawings and specified herein. \r\n\r\nB. Work Included: The work shall include, but not be limited to Pre-insulated and Galvanized metal sheet Duct work. \r\n\r\nC. Related Work Specified Elsewhere \r\n1. Basic Mechanical Requirements \r\n2. Basic Mechanical Materials and Methods \r\n\r\n1.02 QUALITY ASSURANCE \r\n\r\nA. Materials shall conform to the latest edition of industry standards and reference specifications specified herein and to applicable codes and requirements of local authorities having jurisdiction. \r\n\r\n1. Fabrication of pre-insulated panels shall comply with Fire Mideast Product listing-MPL- and with Factory Production Control-FPC-. \r\n2. Fabrication and installation of ductwork shall conform to applicable XXXX codes and regulations. \r\n\r\nB. System Performance: The system has been designed for optimum performance. Any subsequent alterations to the design must be accompanied by a computer analysis or hand calculations showing that the proposed alterations will still provide the original design volume without increasing the system total pressure. Any unavoidable field changes to the original design (offsets, etc.) shall be reported so that accurateâ€ as built&quot; operating parameters may be established","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35863231852627637602e60eaf9a8b1e09c1bffa","amp;dn":"Specification+of+Ducting+Works","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35863231852627637602e60eaf9a8b1e09c1bffa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,134,50,49,133,38,39,99,118,2,230,14,175,154,139,30,9,193,191,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

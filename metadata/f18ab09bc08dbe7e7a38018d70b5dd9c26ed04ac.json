However, as manufacturing devices become increasingly smaller, the use of a directed-energy ion beam is finding novel industrial applications that require the custom tailoring of new materials and devices, including magnetic storage devices, photonics, opto-electronics, and molecular transport. Engineering Thin Films and Nanostructures with Ion Beams offers a thorough narrative of the recent advances that make this technology relevant to current and future applications.\r\n\r\nFeaturing internationally recognized researchers, the book compiles their expertise in a multidimensional source that:\r\n\r\nHighlights the mechanisms and visual evidence of the effects of single-ion impacts on metallic surfaces\r\nConsiders how ion-beam techniques can help achieve higher disk-drive densities \r\nIntroduces gas-cluster ion-beam technology and reviews its precedents\r\nExplains how ion beams are used to aggregate metals and semiconductors into nanoclusters with nonlinear optical properties\r\nAddresses current challenges in building equipment needed to produce nanostructures in an industrial setting \r\nExamines the combination of ion-beam techniques, particularly with physical vapor deposition \r\nDelineates the fabrication of nanopillars, nanoflowers, and interconnected nanochannels in three dimensions by using atomic shadowing techniques \r\nIllustrates the production of nanopores of varying dimensions in polymer films, alloys, and superconductors using ion-beam irradiation\r\nShows how fingerprints can be made more reliable as forensic evidence by recoil-mixing them into the substrate using ion beams\r\n\r\nFrom the basics of the ion-beam modification of materials to state-of-the-art applications, Engineering Thin Films and Nanostructures with Ion Beams is a comprehensive text that provides a complete retrospective of the technology and illustrates the wider landscape for which ion beam techniques are becoming increasingly applicable","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f18ab09bc08dbe7e7a38018d70b5dd9c26ed04ac","amp;dn":"Engineering+Thin+Films+and+Nanostructures+with+Ion+Beams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f18ab09bc08dbe7e7a38018d70b5dd9c26ed04ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,138,176,155,192,141,190,126,122,56,1,141,112,181,221,156,38,237,4,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

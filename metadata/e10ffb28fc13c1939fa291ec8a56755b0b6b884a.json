Manufactured in its millions, it was used or copied by many countries. It is still one of the most collected relics of the war; but despite its relative availability, prices have reached levels that challenge collectors to protect themselves by acquiring in-depth knowledge. This book, by a collector of 30 years' standing, offers a detailed masterclass in the patterns, component parts and finishes of the combat helmets used by the German Army, Navy and Air Force. It is illustrated with a superb selection of rare period photos, colour photos of collected examples, and striking colour paintings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e10ffb28fc13c1939fa291ec8a56755b0b6b884a","amp;dn":"Wehrmacht+Combat+Helmets+1933-45","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e10ffb28fc13c1939fa291ec8a56755b0b6b884a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,15,251,40,252,19,193,147,159,162,145,236,138,86,117,91,11,107,136,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

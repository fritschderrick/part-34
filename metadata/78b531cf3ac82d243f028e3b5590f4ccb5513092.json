This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nThis is the last three hours of a four hour show. I supplied the eight missing songs. If you don't want to play them, skip all the files that start with double zero.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nOne singer/song writer in the countdown is the youngest person ever to receive an honorary doctorate degree in music from Princeton University.\n\nCasey tells us whatever happened to Jan and Dean.\n\nThere is a song in the countdown that features the largest group of musicians to hit the chart since the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;What American recording artist has been the most successful in the 70's?&quot; I would never have guessed the answer to this one.\n\nOne song in the top ten gets there by moving up an incredible 28 places!\n\nIn 1968, a long established recording star finally hit number one for the first time and that number one record was the last time he was able to make the top 40 for eleven years. This week, the hit that ended that famine is in the top ten.\n\n40: Rainbow Connection - Kermit The Frog\n39: Don't Bring Me Down - Electric Light Orchestra\n38: Fins - Jimmy Buffet\n37: You're Only Lonely - J.D.

He was one of the most important, prolific and prominent composers of the classical period. He is often called the &quot;Father of the Symphony&quot; and &quot;Father of the String Quartet&quot; because of his important contributions to these genres. He was also instrumental in the development of the piano trio and in the evolution of sonata form.\nA life-long resident of Austria, Haydn spent much of his career as a court musician for the wealthy Hungarian aristocratic EsterhÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡zy family on their remote estate. Isolated from other composers and trends in music until the later part of his long life, he was, as he put it, &quot;forced to become original&quot;. At the time of his death, he was one of the most celebrated composers across Europe.\nJoseph Haydn was the brother of Michael Haydn, himself a highly regarded composer, and Johann Evangelist Haydn, a tenor. He was also a close friend of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and a teacher of Ludwig van Beethoven.\n\nWynton Learson Marsalis (born October 18, 1961) is an American trumpeter and composer. He is among the most prominent jazz musicians of the modern era and is also a well-known instrumentalist in classical music. He is also the Artistic Director of Jazz at Lincoln Center. A compilation of his series of inspirational letters to a young jazz musical student, named Anthony, has been published as To a Young Jazz Musician.\n\nMarsalis has made his reputation with a combination of skill in jazz performance and composition, a sophisticated yet earthy and hip personal style, an impressive knowledge of jazz and jazz history, and skill as a virtuoso classical trumpeter. As of 2006, he has made sixteen classical and more than thirty jazz recordings, has been awarded nine Grammys between the genres, and has been awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music, the first time it has been awarded for a jazz recording.\n\nYo-Yo Ma (born October 7, 1955) is a French-born Chinese-American virtuoso cellist and composer and winner of multiple Grammy Awards. He is one of the most revered cellists of the 20th and 21st centuries. He is also a highly accomplished musician on the piano, viola, and violin.\nMa has been referred to as &quot;omnivorous&quot; by critics, and possesses a more eclectic repertoire than is typical for classical musicians. A sampling of his versatility in addition to numerous recordings of the standard classical repertoire would include his recordings of Baroque pieces using period instruments; American bluegrass music; traditional Chinese melodies including the soundtrack to the film Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon; the tangos of Argentinian composer ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½stor Piazzolla; an eclectic and unusual collaboration with Bobby McFerrin (where Ma admits to being terrified of the improvisation McFerrin pushes him toward); as well as the music of modern minimalist Philip Glass in such works as the 2002 piece, Naqoyqatsi. In 2006, a soundtrack album was released of the music from the 2005 film, Memoirs of a Geisha. He is known for his smooth, rich tone as well as his considerable virtuosity, including a cello recording of NiccolÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² Paganini's 24th Caprice for solo violin, ZoltÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n KodÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ly's cello sonata, and other demanding works.\n\nCho-Liang Lin, born in 1960 in Hsinchu, Taiwan, is a Taiwanese American violinist who is renowned for his appearances as a soloist with major orchestras, also known as Veaon Lin. &quot;Musical America&quot; named him its &quot;Instrumentalist of the Year&quot; in 2000. He founded the Taipei International Music Festival in 1997, the largest classical music festival in the history of his native country, performing to an indoor audience of over 53,000.\nCho-Liang Lin is a violinist whose career has spanned the globe for 27 years. Lin was born in 1960 in Hsinchu, a quiet college town 70 km (45 miles) south of Taipei, a research center where his father worked as a nuclear physicist. He began playing violin at the age of five. Recognizing that he needed to pursue his violin studies abroad, he made his way to Australia by himself when he was only 12 years old; he spent three years in Sydney. His commanding technique and precocious abilities then led him to Juilliard School, where he studied with the eminent Dorothy DeLay, teacher to such greats as Itzhak Perlman, Gil Shaham, Midori Goto, and Sarah Chang. He made his public debut in New York City at the age of 19, playing Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 3 at Avery Fisher Hall.\nSince his dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©but at Lincoln CenterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Mostly Mozart Festival at the age of nineteen, he has appeared with virtually every major orchestra in the world, including the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra and New York Philharmonic. He has over twenty recordings to his credit, ranging from the concertos of Mozart, Mendelssohn, Sibelius, and Prokofiev, to Christopher Rouse and Tan Dun, as well as the chamber music of Schubert, Brahms, Tchaikovsky and Ravel. His recording partners include Yefim Bronfman, Yo-Yo Ma, Wynton Marsalis, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Leonard Slatkin, Michael Tilson Thomas, Isaac Stern and Helen Huang. His recordings have been critically acclaimed, winning several Grammy nominations and The GramophoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Record of the Year award. He has been a member of the Juilliard School faculty since 1991, and, in 2006, he also started to teach at Rice University. Lin is currently the music director of La Jolla SummerFest in California.\nHe is also featured in the film 4 as the principal violin of the Vivaldi's Autumn in one of the Four Quartets of the Four Seasons.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.

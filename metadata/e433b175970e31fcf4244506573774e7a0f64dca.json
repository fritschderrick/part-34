Braziller | 1962 | Pdf | Eng | 235 pag | 32.7 MB\n\nWhen he died in 1955, James Agee had publihshed three booksÃ¢â‚¬â€a volume of verse, a short novel, and a wholly sui-generis prose commentary called Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.\nSince then, his literary executors have added three more: two collections of Agee on Film and the Pulitzer Prize novelÃ¢â‚¬â€later dramatizedÃ¢â‚¬â€A Death in the Family, combining to form a body of work which easily assures him a unique place in American literature.\nThe present edition amounts to ninety some letters written over a period of thirty years to an Episcopalian priest who was not only the author's oldest friend, but, in a way, his foster father. Beginning in 1925, when Agee was still a student at Exeter, they annotate his abundant life as an American writer and maverick soul until the very day of his death, by heart attack, in May, 1955","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e433b175970e31fcf4244506573774e7a0f64dca","amp;dn":"Letters+of+James+Agee+to+Father+Flye+%28Literature+History%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e433b175970e31fcf4244506573774e7a0f64dca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,51,177,117,151,14,49,252,244,36,69,6,87,55,116,231,160,246,77,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

After examining wind characteristics, it discusses the measurement and siting of individual wind turbines and wind farms. The author then presents the aerodynamics, operation, control, applications, and types of wind turbines. He describes the design of wind turbines and system performance for single wind turbines, water pumping, and wind farms. He also explores the political and economic factors regarding the adoption of wind as an energy source.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cc1f365da921e99ca6ad58cdef42b0f80c0af17","amp;dn":"Wind+Energy+-+Renewable+Energy+and+the+Environment+2009+%28Malestr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cc1f365da921e99ca6ad58cdef42b0f80c0af17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,193,243,101,218,146,30,153,202,106,213,140,222,244,43,15,128,192,175,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Express your creative vision with shapes, color, effects, and typography. Adobe Illustrator CC works with speed and stability on large, complex files, and move designs efficiently among AdobeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creative applications.\n\nFeatures :\n\nLive Shapes: Rectangles and Rounded Rectangles\nRectangles now have quickly modifiable corners, including independent radius control. Corner attributes are retained if you scale and rotate your rectangle. Now Illustrator remembers your work Ã¢â‚¬â€ width, height, rotation, corner treatment Ã¢â‚¬â€ so you can return to your original shape.\n\nPen tool preview\nSee the path youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re drawing before you drop your next point. A rubberband-like line from your last anchor point to the tip of the pen appears as you draw. Visualize where the next curve will go as you plot your next point Ã¢â‚¬â€ and spend less time cleaning up paths.\n\nAnchor point enhancements\nFine adjustment of curves is now easier. New anchor point controls allow unequal or different-direction handles to be dragged as you draw to control the smoothness of each segment. You can even change a corner point to smooth without ruining your shape.\n\nSnap to pixel, point, and grid updates\nWhen snapping is turned on, your anchor points align perfectly to your choice of pixel, grid, or point. But your anchor handles should not. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re now disengaged from snapping so you can preserve the precision of your curves and achieve fine control while editing.\n\nClose paths with better control\nClose your paths with precision and predictability. As you complete a drawing, you now have more control connecting the end and start points. Reposition your closing point or choose to break the direction lines to adjust the closing curve exactly as you wish.\n\nWindows GPU acceleration\nNew GPU acceleration for Windows lets you work faster on Windows 7 or 8 computers. This feature requires an Adobe-certified NVIDIA graphics card with at least 1GB of VRAM.\n\nTypekit missing fonts workflow\nWhen you open a document, missing fonts are now automatically replaced. Illustrator CC searches the Typekit desktop font library and if the missing font is available it will sync through Creative Cloud with just a click.\n\nAnd so much more\nAlso includes: Improvements to the Missing Fonts dialog and enhancements to text-related layout and typing features.\n\nWhat's new :\n\nofficial site does not provide any info about changes in this version\n\nNotes :\n\n* NOTICE TO USERS: Internet connection, Adobe ID, and acceptance of license agreement required to activate and use this product.

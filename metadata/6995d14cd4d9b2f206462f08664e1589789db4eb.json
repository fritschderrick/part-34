Set in a remote town in the Ozarks, it claims to be an attempt to draw attention to the lack of laws banning child marriage in many states. The film is very controversial both for its theme, and for showing twelve-year-old actress Shirley Mills nude during an infamous skinny dipping scene. Although the Hays Code prohibited onscreen nudity, the movie got around this by being produced and distributed independent of the studio system, and by claiming to be educational. Although it was banned in many areas, the movie's controversial nature gave it a certain infamy and it played on the so-called exploitation circuit for many years.\nDescription from Wikipedia, whole article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Bride\nThis film in the IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029989/\n\nThis movie seems to be public domain because of its age.\n\nNote: There is a version of this movie arount where the end is missing.

With bass ace Eddie Gomez and super drummer Al Foster successfully holding on, the exuberant pianist turns eight jazz standards inside out and takes &quot;Classical Gas&quot; as an unaccompanied solo.  Highlights of this typically high-powered Enriquez date include &quot;All Blues,&quot; &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird,&quot; Thelonious Monk's &quot;Four in One,&quot; and &quot;Cherokee&quot;.\n\nBobby Enriquez just blows me away on this CD!!!! I love his band, but the pieces he plays alone are what really freaked me out! I have never heard anyone play the piano with such technical ability, feeling, and humor all at the same time.

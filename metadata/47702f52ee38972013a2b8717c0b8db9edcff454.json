Beginning with their first initial meeting and their first wedding, the vast majority of this book covers their struggles after the accident, which occurred when they had been married only two months. Once it is clear that Krickitt's memory is forever altered, the Carpenter's struggle to date again, love again and eventually marry again.\n\nThe Carpenters are devout Christians and believe that God uses them infinitely through their incredible story. Throughout the book, the entire Carpenter family leans on God through good times and bad, with heartbreaking honesty. Their story is one of doubting God's plan, but having faith that God does indeed have a plan.\n\nI found that the unsaid question at the core of this book is &quot;What would you do?&quot;. Would you have survived the accident? Would you trust God? Would you have stayed true to your vows? Would you fall in love with your spouse all over again? Read this book to see how Kim and Krickitt Carpenter responded with grace, dignity and perseverance.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47702f52ee38972013a2b8717c0b8db9edcff454","amp;dn":"The+Vow+-+%28Non-Fiction%29+%28pdf%2Crtf%2Cepub%2Clit%2Clrf%2Cmobi%2Cfb2%2Cpdb%2Ctxt%2Ch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47702f52ee38972013a2b8717c0b8db9edcff454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,112,47,82,238,56,151,32,19,162,184,113,124,11,141,185,237,207,244,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

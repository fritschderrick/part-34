This tiny, but handy tool disables \nthe new Facebook timeline feature and restores the classic look, \nwithout changing the timeline behavior for other visitors of your Facebook profile. \nThe extension basically works by hiding the timeline, so you can view your own and othersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ profiles\nin the old style. \nTimelineRemove works automatically once installed, and a button is added to the toolbar that lets \nyou toggle the timeline on and off, whenever you want. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ae5d7524467852751b1e7d015dcb7e2b41d71a0","amp;dn":"TimeLine+facebook+remover","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ae5d7524467852751b1e7d015dcb7e2b41d71a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,229,215,82,68,103,133,39,81,177,231,208,21,220,183,226,180,29,113,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

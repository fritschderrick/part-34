Laudon, Brian Hill, Robin L. Pickering, and Azimuth Interactive (thank you all for your hard work - publishers just need to provide Ebook downloads for these books so we don't have to pirate them)\nISBN: 0-13-144743-2 / 0131447432\n\nI tore apart my textbook and scanned it, so you don't have to carry that fat book around in your backpack as well as your laptop. Just carry your laptop with this PDF. Simple as that! Save some trees.\n\nSorry for the kinda screwy quality of the pages. Acrobat did a really poor job of adjusting the pages. Took all day to get it into the computer, so &quot;auto adjust&quot; sounded like a welcome idea.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8eb9faa25455da05004b4baa8fa4e42cc32ae97a","amp;dn":"Windows+Server+2003+Managing+and+Maintaining+0-13-144743-2+Ebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8eb9faa25455da05004b4baa8fa4e42cc32ae97a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,185,250,162,84,85,218,5,0,75,75,170,143,164,228,44,195,42,233,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Storm King (3:17)\n\nHaving spent the better part of the last decade balancing her populist moral sense and her wry brand of humor with her love of catchy pop music, Dar Williams returns to the hyper-literate, folksinger style of her earliest albums on In the Time of Gods. If the album isn't a full-on retreat back to the coffeehouse, it's easily the singer-songwriter's most traditional folk-leaning and least accessible work since 2000's The Green World. That isn't a poor aesthetic decision in and of itself: Williams does confessional folk songwriting better than just about anyone, but the album isn't enhanced by a loosely defined concept, and her writing suffers from a few uncharacteristic lapses in quality.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/04/20/dar-williams/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/04/20/dar-williams/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97d2c682ee126e046bf7aa6263ec2948c69b305a","amp;dn":"Dar+Williams...In+the+Time+of+Gods%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97d2c682ee126e046bf7aa6263ec2948c69b305a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,210,198,130,238,18,110,4,107,247,170,98,99,236,41,72,198,155,48,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Grey and Mr. Brown are heavily armed and overpower the motorman and novice conductor to take control of the train. Between stations they separate the front car from the remainder of the train, setting passengers in the back cars and the motorman free. The four demand $1 million ransom within exactly one hour for the remaining eighteen hostages, including the conductor. If their demands are not met in time or their directions are not followed precisely, they will begin to shoot hostages dead, one every minute the money is late. Wisecracking Lt. Zach Garber of the transit police ends up being the primary communicator between the hijackers and the authorities, which includes transit operations, his own police force, the NYPD, and the unpopular and currently flu ridden mayor who will make the ultimate decision of whether to pay the ransom.\n\n\n\n***** As Always, My Thanks in advance to those who stay on to seed after their download has been completed it is much appreciated *****\n\n\n\n\n\n          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072251&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072251&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOther Downloads you may Like\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Spoofy007&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Spoofy007&lt;/a&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a91609a6268ad6a64900c296f417aab49d6c0deb","amp;dn":"The+Taking+of+Pelham+123%281974%29+Multi+Audio%26amp%3BSubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a91609a6268ad6a64900c296f417aab49d6c0deb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,22,9,166,38,138,214,166,73,0,194,150,244,23,170,180,157,108,13,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

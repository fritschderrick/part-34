Campbell Scott portrays the eponymous Roger, a hotshot advertising executive whose recent, ill-fated affair with his attractive, older boss (Isabella Rossellini) seems to have undone his sense of his own masculinity. This leads him into a downward spiral of alcohol abuse and resentment toward the opposite sex that comes to a head when he takes his visiting 16-year-old nephew (Jesse Eisenberg) out on the town with the goal of helping him lose his virginity. Dialogue drives Roger Dodger -- Scott, in a dead-on performance, delivers brilliantly acerbic diatribes about the battle of the sexes with cocky confidence and the zeal of the converted. Smug and arrogant, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a mentor from hell who spews out his secret frustrations onto his naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve protÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© with a force that will make some viewers cringe. Yet, we gradually see this monsterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s faÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ade begin to crack. In a scene in which Roger and his nephew encounter two attractive and  available singles (Jennifer Beals and Elizabeth Berkley) at a bar, RogerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s slick witticisms are no match for the boyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s innocent romanticism. Roger Dodger stops short of the bleak alienation of LaBute's In the Company of Men or Your Friends &amp; Neighbors, but it nonetheless avoids any easy catharsis. Roger may not be likable, but he rings true, and understanding him ultimately becomes more important than sympathizing with him.\n\nIMdB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299117/ | Rating: 7.2 / 10 (7,863 votes)\n                                     \nGeneral.\n                                                                  \nComplete name                    : Roger.Dodger.2002.DVDRip.XviD-KARiNA.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFile size                        : 1.37 GB\nDuration                         : 1hr 43mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 866 Kbps\nSource                           : Lions Gate NTSC DVD9\n                                       \nVideo.                         \n\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nBit rate                         : 1 411 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 400 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.204\nStream size                      : 529 MiB (76%)\n\nAudio.                           \n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 168 MiB (24%)\nLanguage                         : English\n\nKARiNA.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:721421822f6f0372e7087948aba5d92714f96326","amp;dn":"Roger.Dodger.2002.DVDRip.XviD-KARiNA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"721421822f6f0372e7087948aba5d92714f96326","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,20,33,130,47,111,3,114,231,8,121,72,171,165,217,39,20,249,99,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

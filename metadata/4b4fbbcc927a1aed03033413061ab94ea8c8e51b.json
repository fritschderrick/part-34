In order to avoid the total slaughter, their leaders agree to have an armistice. Along the centuries, the two balanced sides are divided and the forces of light watch and control the vampires, a.k.a. as the forces of night. Among the humans lives &quot;The Others&quot;, i.e., persons with supernatural powers including witches, sorcerers and vampires and with the free will to choose which side to join. The legend says that the two forces will be unbalanced by &quot;The Great Other&quot;, and the side this powerful being selects will win the battle. In 1992, in Moscow, Anton Gorodetsky joins the forces of the light while hiring a witch for a black magic. In the present days, he faces the consequences of his act. \n\nThe Prequel to Day Watch Dubbed in English.\n\nVideo Quality : 7 of 10\n\nAudio Quality : 7 of 10\n\n\nPlease Be Kind &amp; Seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b4fbbcc927a1aed03033413061ab94ea8c8e51b","amp;dn":"Night+Watch++Eng.Dub+Dvd+Rip+%5BRpM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b4fbbcc927a1aed03033413061ab94ea8c8e51b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,79,187,204,146,122,26,237,3,3,52,19,6,26,185,78,168,200,229,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

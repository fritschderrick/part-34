Although made \nusing the Unreal Engine, Rune is a third-person perspective game without any \nshooting. The weapons used in the game include swords, axes, maces, and other \nmedieval/fantasy melee weapons. Despite using an engine made for shooting, \nthe interface lends itself well to a playing style consisting of running, jumping, \nand hacking at opponents.\n\nAn innovative feature of the game is that anything dropped by a dead opponent \ncan be picked up and used. This extends to include body parts. Limbs can be swung \nas clubs, and grotesquely enough, heads can be carried and used as weapons. \nAlthough the game includes no ranged weapons, any weapon can be thrown. The \nhandaxe is a commonly thrown weapon because of the range and speed with which it \ntravels through the air.\n\nCurrently this release allows up to four player to go through the \nentire main PC campaign on various difficulty settings through an internet \nor LAN configuration, without needing to purchase Rune or Rune: Halls of Vahallah. \nLike all Federation releases this one has been upgraded to be both portable and \nthinner, while utilizing less active memory. Several scripts have additionally \nbeen added to prevent crashes and a critical network bug (Winsock Incrimination)\nrelated to Vista incompatibility. It is also noteworthy that this release has had \nall its loading screens removed as they are deemed unnecessary.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Miscellaneous Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease Note The Following:\n\n.I.\nThe Federation takes no responsibility for any damage that may come to your \ncomputer through the trial of this game. This mod has been tested to work \non Windows XP and Vista. No support or technical assistance will be provided. \nEver. Creation of this release took a lifetime of unpaid labour. \n.II.\nThe mod utilized in this release was made by the Rune Co-op Mod Team who neither \nsupport nor condone software piracy. The Federation has released their work \nwithout their permission.\n.III.\nThe Rune Server Launcher utilized in this release was created by &quot;Critter&quot;\nfrom Dot Cafe's House of Pain who neither supports nor condones software piracy.\nThe Federation has released his/her work without his/her permission.\n.IV.\nThis game can work on single player featuring the main campaigns or through \nthe co-op mod and unlike most release appears legitimate online when joining or \nhosting a server. \n.V.\nTo all the Fans, Friends, Foes, Members and Affiliates, of the FEDERATION:\n\n\t\t\t-----------------------\n\t\t\t|THANKS FOR EVERYTHING| \n                        -----------------------\n\nBecause of you we are &quot;STILL UNDERGROUND&quot; and &quot;STILL ALIVE&quot;.\n[54686f73652057686f204b6e6f772055732043616e2046696e64205573]\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteps:\n\n(1.) Extract the contents of the &quot;Rune - Co-op.rar&quot; file to a directory of your \nchoice and then Navigate to the extracted directory (by default the &quot;Rune -  \nCo-op&quot;  directory). \n\nNote: This release is portable and therefore the binaries/executables within \nmake no changes to the game/system files which are already updated, modded, \nand cracked.\n\nNote: If prompted by the &quot;RUNE CO-OP - SERVER&quot; binary/executable to \nselect the &quot;Rune.ini&quot; file associated with this release it can be found in\nthe &quot;.RUNESYSTEM&quot; directory.\n\n(3.) Double-click on the &quot;RUNE CO-OP - CLIENT&quot; binary/executable whose name \ncorresponds with the desired game. Press the &quot;ESC&quot; key to access the main menu. \n\nShortcut Information:\n\n&quot;RUNE CO-OP - CLIENT&quot;         - Rune Multiplayer/Singleplayer Co-op Gameplay\n&quot;RUNE CO-OP - SERVER&quot;         - Rune Server Launching Application\n\nNotes:\n\nExtra content, including game covers and manuals, are located in the &quot;.Extras&quot; \ndirectory.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  In The Pipeline\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nT-BOX - ZKZ of the Federation Team\n\nGames - Pending\nEMUs  - Complete\nNFO   - Pending\nTest  - Complete\n\nThis release is imminent. This project seeks to combine a Lite (less than 700m)\nVista build, bootscreen, frontend, registry tweaks, several related \napplications, twenty-plus emulators and tens of thousands of various game \nimages and ROMS in an orderly package. This package would then allow a user \nto easily create a SF personal computer (or any other light PC) that would \nact as any console from the first to sixth generation. This has been a huge\nundertaking but if it is successful this project will provide the PC scene with \nthe first real replacement for consoles. Please understand that projects like \nthis one can have unsuspected kinks. Please be patient.\n\nFarCry Co-op - BHD UPDATE*\n\nGame  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Complete\nTest  - Complete - Loads of Fun\n\nThis update will include the Black Hawk Down Assault Co-op mini mod made \nfor FarCry.

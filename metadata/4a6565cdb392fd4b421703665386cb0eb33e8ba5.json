(2005)\n\nSize: 42,3 Mb\nBitrate: 220 Kbps average\n\nIt was a story that could not fail. Morrissey, seven years in exile, returns to the stage on his 45th birthday in the bosom of the city that bore him, and the crowd that meets him at the MEN could only have emphasised their love for him more by setting palm leaves before him and popping him on a donkey. Let's face it; his glories are usually followed by him being crucified.\n\nAll the usual trademarks are present. Arms lunge at the stage from within security's grasp and he simply smiles a 'good try, good try...'. Acknowledgement of his birthday comes in a simple 'where did the years go? Why did the years go?' His shirt gets to breaking point with sweat, before being thrown to the masses to be torn apart and treasured. Vintage and current, both in one go.\nThe set list is an extract of every fan's dream; opening with &quot;First Of The Gang To Die&quot; and six more, whipping a sea of faithful devotees into a lather of ecstasy. You&amp;acute;ll find more on the DVD.\n\n\nTracklist:\n01 - First Of The Gang To Die 4.21\n02 - Hairdresser On Fire 3.56\n03 - Irish Blood, English Heart 3.48\n04 - The Headmaster Ritual 4.37\n05 - Subway Train - Everyday Is Like Sunday  4.33\n06 - I Have Forgiven Jesus 3.36\n07 -  I Know It's Gonna Happen Someday 3.46\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a6565cdb392fd4b421703665386cb0eb33e8ba5","amp;dn":"Morrissey+-+Who+Put+the+M+In+Manchester%3F+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a6565cdb392fd4b421703665386cb0eb33e8ba5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,101,101,205,179,146,253,75,66,23,3,102,83,134,203,14,179,62,139,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

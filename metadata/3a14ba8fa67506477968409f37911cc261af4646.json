Open the image with ultra ISO and go to bootable menu and select the Write Disk Image, select u r thumb drive and start writing. thats it. it ll boot up. However u mother board should allow the USB device booting. For more info see u r mother board carton.\n\n4) Booting takes more time, what shall i do ?\n\nWell the booting usually take 25,000 ms. if it takes more than it is, then Go to run &gt; type msconfig &gt; go to boot tab &gt; select the NoGUI boot and apply &gt; exit\n\nFurther more try to clean the OS with registry cleaner or ccleaner which i have provided.\n\n5) Can i change the Boot screen as u did ?\n\nYes Ofcourse u can.

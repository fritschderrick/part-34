The Michael Jackson references continued, as Trey teased the audience by saying that Jimmy was listening to the Halloween album while the band played a Beat It tease. Also, the second set was preceded by recorded Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' and Thriller teases from Michael Jackson's Thriller album. The second set &quot;musical costume&quot; was The Who's Quadrophenia and was performed with Dave Grippo on alto saxophone, Don Glasgo on trombone, Joey Sommerville on trumpet and Alan Parshley on French horn. During Bell Boy, crew member Leigh Fordham, clad in a bell boy outfit, sang Keith MoonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original part. All of the Quadrophenia songs, as well as My Generation, were Phish debuts. YEM was almost 40 minutes long, contained teases from Trey of The Real Me and DEG, and was preceded by the audience chess move. The chosen fan, dressed as a Wookie, cracked under the pressure and could not choose a move on stage, prompting a quote from Fish that Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wookies canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t play chess.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The Rock was teased after the failed move. Jesus Just Left Chicago featured Grippo on alto saxophone; Suzy Greenberg featured Grippo, Glasgo and Somerville. My Generation was performed acoustic. Before My Generation, the crew set up a Keith Moon replica drum set on stage. After the song, Fishman and Trey destroyed the drum set a la The Who. Finally, a stagehand brought out a large plunger. Trey pressed it and set off a huge explosion backstage. This show was officially released as Live Phish 14. In the soundcheck, Suzy Greenberg was performed three times: the first with only Grippo, the second with the band and Grippo, and the third with all of the horns, alternate lyrics, and Bell Boy quotes. The jam through the end of the soundcheck was played with horns.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec8468b77b7d20f10f3f44e57a24fffc958dc6f6","amp;dn":"Phish+-+10-31-95+-+Rosemont+Horizon+%28LP14%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec8468b77b7d20f10f3f44e57a24fffc958dc6f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,132,104,183,123,125,32,241,15,63,68,229,122,36,255,252,149,141,198,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

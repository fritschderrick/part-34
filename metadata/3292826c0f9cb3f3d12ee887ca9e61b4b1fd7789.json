The song was written by Ciara, The-Dream, and Tricky Stewart, with the latter two producing the song as well. Taken from her upcoming fourth studio album Basic Instinct, the song serves as the second single from the album. It was released in the United States as a digital download on September 7, 2010. The album version of the song features The-Dream, however, he only has backing vocals on the single version.\n\nThe video was directed in Los Angeles, California on September 10, 2010 by Colin Tilley. It premiered via the Vevo network on September 29, 2010.\n\nThe video begins with a black sillouette of Ciara which resembles the single cover artwork, and is a recurrring image used throughout the video. It crosses between this and another scene where Ciara is dressed in a short t-shirt which reveals her abs and jeans. She moves rhythmically to the music. In the video's third scene she is braced against a stone wall where she grinds to the beat of the song. This last scene is the only one shot in color.\n\nIn September 2009, Tricky Stewart, confirmed via Rap-Up that he and The-Dream  had spent the entire summer with Ciara working on her upcoming fourth studio album. He also named &quot;Speechless&quot; as one of two songs he hoped would appear on the album. The album version of the song leaked in March 2010, featuring vocals from The-Dream. However, following the release of its single cover on August 18, 2010, it was confirmed that the single version would feature only Ciara.\n\nBasic Instinct is the upcoming fourth studio album by American R&amp;B singer Ciara.

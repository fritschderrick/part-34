The film was adapted by David J. Schow and John Shirley, and directed by Alex Proyas. The Crow stars Brandon Lee, in his final film, as Eric Draven, a rock musician who comes back from the dead to avenge his own murder, as well as that of his fiancÃƒÂ©e. While filming in the closing weeks of production, Lee was killed when a dummy bullet, which had become lodged in one of the guns, was fired into his abdomen. Despite the incident, the film was a critical and commercial success upon \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Crow 1994\n\n\nThe soundtrack to the movie The Crow was released in 1994. Its biggest hit song was &quot;Big Empty&quot; by the Stone Temple Pilots, which was also on their album Purple. This album featured many covers including Nine Inch Nails who covered Joy Division's &quot;Dead Souls,&quot; Pantera who covered Poison Idea's &quot;The Badge,&quot; and Rollins Band who covered Suicide's &quot;Ghost Rider,&quot; which is about a Marvel Comics character. Rage Against the Machine re-recorded their 1991 b-side Darkness of Greed and simply re-named it &quot;Darkness&quot; especially for this soundtrack. Also, The Cure wrote the song &quot;Burn&quot; for the movie. Despite requests, they have never performed the song live.[citation needed] James O'Barr, the creator of The Crow, is a big fan of The Cure and lyrics to the song &quot;The Hanging Garden&quot; by The Cure even appear in the original comic book.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Burn&quot; - The Cure (Robert Smith, Simon Gallup, Boris Williams, Perry Bamonte) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:39 \n2.\t&quot;Golgotha Tenement Blues&quot; - Machines of Loving Grace (Scott Benzel, Mike Fisher, Stuart Kupers, Thomas Melchionda) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:01 \n3.\t&quot;Big Empty&quot; - Stone Temple Pilots (Dean DeLeo, Scott Weiland) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:56 \n4.\t&quot;Dead Souls&quot; - Nine Inch Nails (Joy Division) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:54 \n5.\t&quot;Darkness&quot; - Rage Against the Machine (Rage Against the Machine) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:41 \n6.\t&quot;Color Me Once&quot; - Violent Femmes (Gordon Gano, Brian Ritchie) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:09 \n7.\t&quot;Ghostrider&quot; - Rollins Band (Martin Rev, Alan Vega) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:45 \n8.\t&quot;Milktoast&quot; (also known as &quot;Milquetoast&quot;) - Helmet (Page Nye Hamilton) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:59 \n9.\t&quot;The Badge&quot; - Pantera (Poison Idea) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:54 \n10.\t&quot;Slip Slide Melting&quot; - For Love Not Lisa (For Love Not Lisa) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:47 \n11.\t&quot;After the Flesh&quot; - My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult (Buzz McCoy, Groovie Mann) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:59 \n12.\t&quot;Snakedriver&quot; - The Jesus and Mary Chain (William Reid, Jim Reid) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:41 \n13.\t&quot;Time Baby III&quot; - Medicine (Jim Goodall, Brad Laner, Jim Putnam, Ruscha, Beth Thompson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:52 \n14.\t&quot;It Can't Rain All the Time&quot; - Jane Siberry (Graeme Revell, Jane Siberry) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:34 \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Crow Ã¢â‚¬â€œ City of Angels 1996\n\n\n\nThe original soundtrack of the 1996 motion picture The Crow: City of Angels, sequel to the 1994 film The Crow. The album includes a cover of the Fleetwood Mac song &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; by Hole, as well as tracks by other heavyweight artists such as White Zombie, Korn and Iggy Pop. Like the original Crow soundtrack, a song by Joy Division (one of O'Barr's favorite bands) is covered, &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; by Bush. Initial pressings contained a small Crow comic in the CD booklet, written by John Wagner and illustrated by Dean Ormston. Hole, Burton C. Bell of Fear Factory, Filter, Tricky and Rob Zombie all returned for the The Crow: Salvation soundtrack.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; - performed by Hole\n2.\t&quot;I'm Your Boogieman&quot; - performed by White Zombie\n3.\t&quot;Jurassitol&quot; - performed by Filter\n4.\t&quot;Naked Cousin&quot; - performed by PJ Harvey\n5.\t&quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; - performed by Bush (Joy Division)\n6.\t&quot;Tonite is a Special Nite (Kaos Mass Confusion Mix) - performed by Tricky vs. The Gravediggaz\n7.\t&quot;Shelf Life&quot; - performed by Seven Mary Three\n8.\t&quot;Knock Me Out&quot; - performed by Linda Perry featuring Grace Slick\n9.\t&quot;Paper Dress&quot; - performed by Toadies\n10.\t&quot;Spit&quot; - performed by NY Loose\n11.\t&quot;Sean Olson&quot; - performed by Korn\n12.\t&quot;Teething&quot; - performed by Deftones\n13.\t&quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog (live)&quot; - performed by Iggy Pop\n14.\t&quot;Lil' Boots&quot; - performed by Pet\n15.\t&quot;City of Angels&quot; - performed by Above the Law featuring Frost \n16.\t&quot;Believe In Angels&quot; - performed by Heather Nova &amp; Graeme Revell (Bonus Track) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Crow Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Salvation 2000\n\n\nThe soundtrack to the third in the Crow film series, The Crow: Salvation album is once again compiled and produced by Jeff Most. As with the soundtrack to The Crow: City of Angels, Salvation includes an otherwise unavailable cover version by Hole: this time of Bob Dylan's &quot;It's All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot;. Several other contemporary big-name artists are also included, indicating that even at this late stage in the series, The Crow brand name still held a certain cache within the grunge / industrial / gothic rock scene. This would not extend to the fourth film, The Crow: Wicked Prayer however, for which no soundtrack album was ever released. In the UK, the release of The Crow: Salvation's soundtrack pre-dated the release of the film itself by four years. The film was finally released straight to DVD in 2004. The Juliette Lewis track is not an example of the actress' recent Juliette and the Licks project. The song is primarily performed by The Infidels, but features a sample of Lewis singing &quot;Born Bad&quot;, taken from the film Natural Born Killers.\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Best Things&quot; - Filter \n2.\t&quot;Living Dead Girl (Naked Exorcism Mix)&quot; - Rob Zombie \n3.\t&quot;Bad Brother&quot; - The Infidels featuring Juliette Lewis \n4.\t&quot;Warm Winter&quot; - Kid Rock \n5.\t&quot;It's All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot; - Hole (Bob Dylan cover) \n6.\t&quot;What You Want&quot; - The Flys \n7.\t&quot;Big God&quot; - Monster Magnet \n8.\t&quot;Painful&quot; - Sin \n9.\t&quot;Antihistamine&quot; - Tricky \n10.\t&quot;Independent Slaves&quot; - Days of the New \n11.\t&quot;Everything Sucks (Again)&quot; - Pitchshifter \n12.\t&quot;Waking Up Beside You (Remix)&quot; - Stabbing Westward \n13.\t&quot;Now is the Time (The Crystal Method Millennium Mix)&quot; - The Crystal Method \n14.\t&quot;Burning Inside&quot; - Static-X featuring Burton C.

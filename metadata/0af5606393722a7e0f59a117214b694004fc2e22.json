No more need of a hardware solution to get RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) protection. Now SoftRAID 3 lets your OS X system have all the benefits of RAID with your own Macintosh and hard disks.\n\n\nFor Speed - RAID 0\n\nSoftRAID 3 writes your data across two or more hard disks so your Mac can read the data faster than if it was reading from one disk. This type of volume is called a Stripe Volume. Stripe Volumes are used primarily by Video, Audio and Graphic Design Professionals.\n\n\nFor Safe Backups - RAID 1\n\nSoftRAID 3 can also write identical blocks of data to 2 or more hard disks simultaneously, giving you an instantaneous backup. This group of disks is called a Mirror Volume. Because you can use individual external and/or internal hard disks to make up a Mirror Volume, you have the ability to archive one or more of the disks offsite for increased security. SoftRAID also uses its Stripe technology when reading a Mirror Volume to give you faster reads. Mirror volumes are used by Server Administrators and anyone needing data security!\n\nSoftRAID 3 General Specifications:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Runs on any Macintosh which uses OS X version 10.4 or higher.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Allows you to create startup volumes with Mirror and non-RAID volumes.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Supports any combination of SCSI, ATA, FireWire, Serial ATA, Fibre Channel and USB disks.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Allows you to create a mix of RAID volumes on the same disks.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Creates non-RAID volumes from single disks, or RAID 0 and RAID 1 volumes from 2 or more disks or parts of disks.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Easily converts volumes created with Apple Disk Utility and SoftRAID 2.x.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Notifies user when volume states change and automatically rebuilds out-of-sync mirror volumes.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0af5606393722a7e0f59a117214b694004fc2e22","amp;dn":"SoftRAID+3.6.6+fully+functional+version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0af5606393722a7e0f59a117214b694004fc2e22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,245,96,99,147,114,42,126,15,89,161,23,33,75,105,64,4,252,46,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

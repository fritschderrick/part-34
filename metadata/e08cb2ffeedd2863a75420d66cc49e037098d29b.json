Donald Quinelle (Robin Williams) is a successful young executive who is called to his boss' office one morning and is fired by a parrot sitting in the CEO's chair -- a method the company uses to axe high-powered execs. Donald meets Sonny Paluso (Walter Matthau), a former gas station owner who is out of work because his business was blown up. At a diner, the two newfound friends witness a robbery and catch sight of the perpetrator, Jerry Reed (Jack Locke). Reed is a mob hit man who swears to kill the two men who saw him commit the crime. Donald, formerly afraid of weapons, becomes obsessed with guns as a way to protect himself from the mob. He enrolls in a survivalist training school in the mountains of Vermont.\n\nWalter Matthau   \t- Sonny Paluso\nRobin Williams  \t- Donald Quinelle\nJerry Reed  \t- Jack Locke\nJames Wainwright  \t- Wes Huntley\nKristen Vigard  \t- Candice Paluso\nAnnie McEnroe  \t- Doreen\nAnne Pitoniak  \t- Betty\nBernard Barrow  \t- TV Manager\nJoseph Carberry  \t- Detective Matt Burke\nTiffany Clark  \t- Tiffany Clark\nMarilyn Cooper  \t- Waitress\nJohn de Bello  \t- Salesman\nMarian Hailey  \t- Jack's Wife\nSkipp Lynch  \t- Wiley\nMichael P.

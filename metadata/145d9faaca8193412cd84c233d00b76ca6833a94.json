The problem\nwith him is that he switches genres easily, between film music, straight-ahead\njazz, avant classical, avant chamber jazz, over his great African trio, duets\nwith Aki Takase, tightly composed modern jazz, to more adventurous music. Not\nall his initiatives are successful, and the breadth of his scope make each new\nalbum a surprise in style. That can be good, but sometimes also disappointing.\n\nThis trio is pure jazz with composed pieces and improvised tracks, but all with\nan adventurous streak, and that's only possible and successful because of the\nsuperb musicianship both technically and creatively. Sclavis is of course on\nbass clarinet, but also on soprano sax, Craig Taborn plays piano and Tom Rainey\ndrums, without a doubt each among the best on their instrument today.\n\nThe compositions range between the melancholy (&quot;La Visite&quot;) and the joyful (&quot;Up\nDown Up&quot;, &quot;Possibilities&quot;), or even the slightly insane (&quot;Luccioles&quot;), but all\nof them are musical delights. On &quot;La Visite&quot;, on which after a long and sad\nTaborn piano moment, Sclavis brings some of the most heart-rending bass\nclarinet-playing that I've heard in a while, slowly driving his beautiful\nplaying to a wailing climax.\n\nSclavis is excellent throughout, using his full skillset on the clarinet from\nclassical over swing to modern music, Taborn and Rainey are not only functional\nbut they create the overall environment becoming a perfect fit for the\nvariations in mood and styles, not just accompanying but creating the context in\nwhich the soloist must journey. Despite the variations, the music is still very\ncoherent. One of Sclavis' least polished albums, yet the rawness of the\nadventure suits him quite well.\n\n--\n\nBy Grego Applegate Edwards\n\nBy Tim Niland\n\nDi Enrico Bettinello (it) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=5779&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=5779&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPor Ricardo Arribas (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jazzitis.com/web/content/eldorado-trio&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jazzitis.com/web/content/eldorado-trio&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPor Pachi Tapiz &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bun.tomajazz.com/2010/09/louis-sclavis-craig-taborn-tom-rainey.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bun.tomajazz.com/2010/09/louis-sclavis-craig-taborn-tom-rainey.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:145d9faaca8193412cd84c233d00b76ca6833a94","amp;dn":"Sclavis%2C+Taborn%2C+Rainey+-+Eldorado+Trio+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"145d9faaca8193412cd84c233d00b76ca6833a94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,93,159,170,202,129,147,65,44,216,76,35,61,0,183,108,166,131,58,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

As the game progresses you will also play Lucas' brother Markus Kane, who became a priest, as well as the police detectives investigating the murder, Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles.\n\nNew York City is stunned by a series of mysterious murders, all following the same pattern: ordinary people are killing absolute strangers in public areas. Lucas Kane becomes another one of these murderers when he suddenly kills a stranger in a men's bathroom. Covered in blood, Lucas regains consciousness with no recollection as to why he committed murder. Lucas must solve the mystery before being incarcerated for life.\n\nYou will play through 44 fast-paced chapters as this paranormal adventure unfolds. Good reflexes and hand-to-eye coordination are necessary to get through the many action sequences. You'll be able to explore the environment and interact with it, and many tasks have a time limit and will require you to act quickly.\n\nA free-flowing game during which players can assume the role of multiple characters and experience the game from multiple viewpoints, Indigo Prophecy allows players actions to affect the plot by offering a scenario driven interactive experience. Through motion picture techniques, players find themselves intimately immersed in the game. \n\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Choose to play as one of four characters including lead character Lucas Kane, \n  Detective Carla Valenti, Detective Tyler Miles (Carla's partner) and Lucas \n  brother Marcus Kane.\n\n* Play through a total of 44 bone-chilling acts and manage the mental health of \n  each main character by choosing the correct course of action and maintaining \n  their psychological balance.\n\n* Special multi-view split-screen allows players to see what is happening in a \n  different area of the game while playing through a particular scenario.\n\n* Motion Physical Action Reaction (MPAR) interface allows the player to make the \n  same movement as his character on screen, which creates a physical \n  identification between the player and his character.\n\n* Physical Action Reaction (PAR) interface is used during mini-game action \n  sequences where the player has to move the analog control sticks in the proper \n  direction in order to succeed.\n\n* More than 50 stuntmen and actors were used to motion capture in-game characters \n  in order to create the most realistic character models, dynamic cinematics and \n  high-caliber, Hollywood-style action sequences.\n\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at 8x or 4x Speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't \nworking.\n\n\nIf Using DVD+R booktype to DVD-ROM.\n(If your Mod-Chip or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R)\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3efb15a29600b6f7de749c8f24cd309c70fdc6b6","amp;dn":"Indigo+Prophecy+%5BNtsc%5D%2C+Ps2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3efb15a29600b6f7de749c8f24cd309c70fdc6b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,251,21,162,150,0,182,247,222,116,156,143,36,205,48,156,112,253,198,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

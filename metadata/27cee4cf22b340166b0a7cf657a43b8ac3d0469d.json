He aspires to make sweeping changes - he's set goals for himself and the people he chose to bring with him, modeling his reign after that of his friend, Logan Church. But Domin may have set too lofty a goal: His normal leadership style isn't working.\n\nWhile juggling a homesick Crane, a moody Mikhail, a bullwhip-wielding Taj, servants with murderous intentions, a visiting ex, and a mate on a dangerous goodwill mission, Domin has to figure out his new role alone. He also must determine how to deal with a conspiracy, all the while falling hard for a man who, for the first time in Domin's life, reciprocates that love. Whether Domin is ready or not, Fate has stepped in to teach him a lesson: Internal threats are just as dangerous as external ones","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27cee4cf22b340166b0a7cf657a43b8ac3d0469d","amp;dn":"Mary+Calmes+-+Change+of+Heart+Book+4+Crucible+of+Fate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27cee4cf22b340166b0a7cf657a43b8ac3d0469d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,206,228,207,34,179,64,22,107,10,124,246,87,164,59,138,195,208,70,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

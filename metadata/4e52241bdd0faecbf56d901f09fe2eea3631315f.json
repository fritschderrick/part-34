While their individual careers spawned earlier interest, Trent Dabbs and Amy Stroup work well enough in tandem to put their solo efforts on the back burner, at least for now. Utilizing relentless rhythms to underscore their wistful resolve, the pair still manage to keep a subtle bond amidst their mutual admiration. Their duets often sound like they were plucked from the Nashville television soundtrack. On songs like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Graffiti HeartsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Right Time to Tell YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all too easy to imagine Gunnar and Scarlett exchanging verses with some starry-eyed glances. With tracks that veer from the playful to the poignant, High Roller raises the stakes and ought to win over those unknowing.\n\t\nBees Left the Trees\n3:32\t\t\n$0.99\n2\t\nCan We Just Be Adults\n3:27\t\t\n$0.99\n3\t\nHigh Roller\n3:31\t\t\n$0.99\n4\t\nI Don't Get High\n3:54\t\t\n$0.99\n5\t\nRight Time to Tell You\n3:42\t\t\n$0.99\n6\t\nMorning Joy\n4:47\t\t\n$0.99\nGraffiti Hearts\n3:01\t\t\n$0.99\n8\t\nPick You Up\n3:41\t\t\n$0.99\n9\t\nTennessee Quick\n4:05\t\t\n$0.99\n10\t\nHeaven\n\n\nPer Reuqest AND SEEEED PLEASE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e52241bdd0faecbf56d901f09fe2eea3631315f","amp;dn":"Sugar+%26amp%3B+The+Hi+Lows+-+High+Roller++2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e52241bdd0faecbf56d901f09fe2eea3631315f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,82,36,27,221,15,174,203,245,109,144,31,9,254,46,234,54,49,49,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

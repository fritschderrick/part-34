There was an issue with the LIVE-stream from hbo tonite where frame rate was of resulting in audio being oos for the first three minutes and because the stream itself was choppy for the first 4 minutes I couldn't fix it and had to wait for hbo to post the segment. This encode still contains the extra new rules segment from the live stream because that was fine. I hope y'all don't mind the delay for a quality release. Funny that this time the scene had actually beat me to the release and posted the main show before I got a chance to post the OVERTIME segment.

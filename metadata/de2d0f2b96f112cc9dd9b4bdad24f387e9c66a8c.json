TextBridge Pro can be run standalone, or from the menu of most word processors, or integrated from Pagis Pro. It will scan that image, or use previously scanned image files of formats BMP, PCX, DCX, TIF, XIF, and Winfax Pro files (there is even a scheduler to do large runs overnight). It can process many pages of images, and can run your scanners Automatic Document Feeder too, if you have one. It can output files in most word processor file formats, and Postscript EPS and HTML too. Or you can route the text directly into a word processor via a Send To menu. \n\nA page from the TextBridge Help File: \n\nTypes of Documents TextBridge Can Recognize\n\nTextBridge Recognition technology retains accurate OCR and format results for a wide range of documents: \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Documents printed on typewriters, phototypesetters, and dot-matrix, impact, ink-jet, and laser printers (color or black &amp; white) \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Documents printed on colored paper \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Hard-copy faxes \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Online single- or multiple-page images from sources such as fax modems \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Photocopied, degraded or dirty documents \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Documents with single or multiple columns in straightforward or complex layouts \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Documents with tables \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Tables composed of cells or created with tabs \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Spreadsheets \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Documents with embedded graphics \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Documents with point sizes ranging from 5 to 72-point type \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Documents composed in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and 51 other languages \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Documents with dual pages \nNote\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢TextBridge is not designed to recognize and retain the layout of forms.

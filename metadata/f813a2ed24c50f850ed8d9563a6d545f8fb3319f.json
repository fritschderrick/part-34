It is divided into sections to make specific plants (or type of plant) easy to locate. The first section covers the basics: garden design, maintenance, fertilizing, etc. This section is good for those with no gardening experience. The best part of the book are the subsequent sections on plants including annuals and perennials, shrubs, trees, bulbs, lawns, vegetables and herbs, fruit and nut trees, indoor plants, cacti, orchids, ferns, and climbers. This layout is perfect for someone who knows what they want to plant (ie trees, annuals) but doesn't know which one. They can peruse through the thousands of full color photographs to find the one they want. Next to the photographs are basic information about the plants: the zones it can grow in, light requirements, etc. The photographs are good, numerous, and in full color. I gave it four stars rather than five because I would like more specific information on how to grow the plants rather than an overview. For the price, though, you can not beat it. It is a great addition to a gardening book reference library.&quot;\n\nAmazon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f813a2ed24c50f850ed8d9563a6d545f8fb3319f","amp;dn":"The+Ultimate+Plant+and+Garden+Book+%28request%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f813a2ed24c50f850ed8d9563a6d545f8fb3319f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,19,162,237,36,197,15,133,14,216,217,86,58,109,84,95,143,179,49,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

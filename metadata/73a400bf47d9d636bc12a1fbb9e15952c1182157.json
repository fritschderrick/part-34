It has the Action the Strategic idea and the level advancing and building of your characters. Although this is not anything you will find everyday no no no this is something you find quite different than others. No matter what the information pages say. You will be on the lead of entire Alien race, floaters which fight to get The tone. Tone is the life energy for the floater world and you have to get it. It is used against a malevolent alien presence called Leviathans in a world of floating islands. This game features all the way new Real-time Strategy type of gameplay and also kinda like Unit based meaning single unit-based actions of its time.\n There are lots of puzzles in the game you will have to solve which increase the gameplay hours and well some of them are also quite tricky ones.

Adams was born in Jacksonville, North Carolina in 1974. While country music was a major part of his family's musical diet when he was young (he's cited Loretta Lynn, George Jones, Merle Haggard, and Johnny Cash as particular favorites), in his early teens Adams developed a taste for punk rock and began playing electric guitar.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59255065db9e7266e1cb27d3f315d24108608c68","amp;dn":"Ryan+Adams+24bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59255065db9e7266e1cb27d3f315d24108608c68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,37,80,101,219,158,114,102,225,203,39,211,243,21,210,65,8,96,140,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

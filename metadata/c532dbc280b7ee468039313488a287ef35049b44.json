Done! _Every_ plane was tested in FSX with Acceleration Pack!\n\n\nWHO:\n----\nThis package is for all new-schooler fans of the Dc-3 who use mainly FSX (like me), and especially dedicated to the FANS OF THE ICE Pilot Tv Show series! JUST GET IT! Like we say in my country... Categoria!!\n\n\nRegards,\njamz\n\n\nPS: I've only added one extra livery.. a gift for the Ice Pilot's fans :) Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c532dbc280b7ee468039313488a287ef35049b44","amp;dn":"MAAM+DC-3+NO-STRESS+INSTALLATION+FOR+FSX+SP2-Acceleration+v2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c532dbc280b7ee468039313488a287ef35049b44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,50,219,194,128,183,238,70,128,57,49,52,136,162,135,239,53,4,155,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

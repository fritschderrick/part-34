These sections cover:\n\n.Background and introductory material,\n\n.Installation processes and vessel requirements,\n\n.Installation cost estimation, and\n\n.Decommissioning methods and cost estimation.\n\nThis self-contained and detailed treatment of the key principles in offshore wind development is supported throughout by visual aids and data tables. &quot;Offshore Wind Energy Cost Modeling &quot;is a key resource for anyone interested in the offshore wind industry, particularly those interested in the technical and economic aspects of installation and decommissioning. The book provides a reliable point of reference for industry practitioners and policy makers developing generalizable installation or decommissioning cost estimates","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf7cfc39340206ae83371f438bdbb500f2ca3e02","amp;dn":"Offshore+Wind+Energy+Cost+Modeling+-++Installation+and+Decommiss","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf7cfc39340206ae83371f438bdbb500f2ca3e02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,124,252,57,52,2,6,174,131,55,31,67,139,219,181,0,242,202,62,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Dr. Ruckman lifts back the veil of respectability and shows the reader exactly what goes on in the classrooms of Christian Colleges and Seminaries: how the studentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ faith in the Bible is replaced with faith in higher Christian education in ten areas of study. The latter half of the book covers the ten supposed errors in the KJV brought up by Gary Hudson in his debate with Dr. Ruckman*. These ten changes made in the text of the AV by the New King James Version serve as excellent examples of how scholars lie and misrepresent the truth about Ã¢â‚¬Å“THEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Greek text (Alexandrian or Receptus) when it comes to overthrowing the authority of the King James Bible.\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Peter S. Ruckman received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alabama and finished his formal education with six years of training at Bob Jones University (four full years and two accelerated summer sessions), completing requirements for the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degree. Reading at a rate of seven hundred words per minute, Dr. Ruckman had managed to read about 6,500 books before receiving his doctorate, and he still reads an average of a book each day.\nDr. Ruckman stands for the absolute authority of the Authorized Version and offers no apology to any recognized scholar anywhere for his stand. In addition to preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible, Dr. Ruckman has produced a comprehensive collection of apologetic and polemic literature and resources supporting the authority of the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f07fdf4ae68030f95429c7027d7250a8c808f40","amp;dn":"King+James+Onlyism+Versus+Scholarship+Onlyism+-+Dr.+Peter+S.+Ruc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f07fdf4ae68030f95429c7027d7250a8c808f40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,7,253,244,174,104,3,15,149,66,156,112,39,215,37,10,140,128,143,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

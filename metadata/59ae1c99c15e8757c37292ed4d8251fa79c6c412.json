For being what typically Quake II is, this is a rather original appearing yet complex variant of the game. There was a issue with shortcuts on the May 30th UL. *(All Issues have been Fixed-this is the Repaired Installer)\n\nMany parts and subparts of the game has been updated, uprgraded or patched. Work has been done to all of the gamex86.dll from CTF, Baseq2, Rogue and Xatrix. The stack in the game's main executable has been increased 16 x times. You also may enjoy some music as well now of your own. (I was caught in room with 4 Stroggs and fired my BFG &amp; the stack Update we did SAVED the Game then!!) I have NEVER recovered from one ever before. \n\nThe version 3.24 was a simple, no-frills patch that fixes bugs (including the nVidia 191.x driver crash) and adds only meager tweaks aside from Ogg Vorbis support.*  Intended for Quake2 purists who have been using the woefully out of date version 3.20, it is not intended to add new features or be an engine mod in its own right however it's a great unofficial improvement. One accepted by the Quake II community and down right welcomed.\n\n* To hear Ogg Vorbis tracks in game, rip the Q2 CD's audio tracks (2-11) to track02-track11.ogg and put them in baseq2/music.  For the mission pack audio tracks, rip the Ground Zero CD's audio tracks (2-11) to track12-track21.ogg.  Don't bother ripping the tracks from the Reckoning CD, as they're a mix of the tracks on the Q2 and Ground Zero CDs.  Everything else will be taken care of internally.\n\nWe also fixed (Hopefully) all of the issues experienced with Russian Edition's\n3.20 thru 3.23. Went as far as to remove our 'Easter Eggs&quot; as well as our Audio and Texture additions. The MOD we included in 3.24 you are able to play the game WITH OR WITHOUT unlike before! You now have shortcuts to the Original game, one with MOD for Single Player, COOP, DM etc. \nKeep on Fragging!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59ae1c99c15e8757c37292ed4d8251fa79c6c412","amp;dn":"Quake+2+v3.24+Russian+Edition+with+SGM+MOD+and+Server+Browser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59ae1c99c15e8757c37292ed4d8251fa79c6c412","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,174,28,153,193,94,135,87,195,114,146,237,77,130,81,250,121,198,196,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

At the end of the 20th century, two of their albums, Their Greatest Hits (1971ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1975) and Hotel California, ranked among the 20 best-selling albums in the U.S. according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Hotel California is ranked 37th in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and the band was ranked #75 on the magazine's 2004 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[2] They also have the best selling album in the U.S. with Their Greatest Hits (1971ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1975), which sold more than 29 million copies. They have sold over 120 million albums worldwide and 100 million in the U.S. alone. They are the fifth highest selling artist in U.S. history and the highest selling American band in U.S. history. No other American band sold more than the Eagles during the 1970's.\n\nThe Eagles broke up in July 1980, but reunited in 1994 for Hell Freezes Over, a mix of live and new studio tracks.They have toured intermittently since then, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2007, Eagles released Long Road out of Eden, their first full studio album in 28 years. The album would top the album charts, release five singles on the Adult Contemporary Charts and win the band two Grammies. The next year they launched The Long Road out of Eden Tour in support of the album.\n\nby WIKIPEDIA\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Take It Easy.wma                                       \n02 - Peaceful, Easy Feeling.wma                             \n03 - Desperado.wma                                          \n04 - Tequila Sunrise.wma                                    \n05 - Best Of My Love.wma                                    \n06 - Lyin' Eyes.wma                                         \n07 - Take It To The Limit.wma                               \n08 - The Long Run.wma                                       \n09 - One Of These Nights.wma                                \n10 - Hotel California.wma                                   \n11 - New Kid In Town.wma                                    \n12 - Life In The Fast Lane.wma                              \n13 - I Can't Tell You Why.wma                               \n14 - Heartache Tonight.wma  \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bed1ec877eada7a1ab4373a14db01ad65bb57c6","amp;dn":"Eagles+-+The+Legend+Of+Eagles+%281987%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bed1ec877eada7a1ab4373a14db01ad65bb57c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,237,30,200,119,234,218,122,26,180,55,58,20,219,1,173,101,187,87,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

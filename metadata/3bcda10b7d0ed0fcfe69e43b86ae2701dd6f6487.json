That makes it an instant draw for crate-digging types, and it should also be attractive to those who want to reach further than the Shaft and Superfly soundtracks for their fix of funky '70s music. Bob James' &quot;Nautilus,&quot; featuring one of the most frequently sampled breaks of all time, is included here, along with more adventurous cuts like Gary Bartz's &quot;Celestial Blues,&quot; Herbie Hancock's &quot;Wiggle Waggle,&quot; the Ramsey Lewis Trio's version of &quot;Slippin' into Darkness,&quot; and Mandrill's &quot;Fat City Strut.&quot; This is one of the best discs in the series. ~ Andy Kellman, All Music Guide\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://static.rateyourmusic.com/album_images/64904685691ae80d80834262916e7c73/155099.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://static.rateyourmusic.com/album_images/64904685691ae80d80834262916e7c73/155099.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\n1.Wiggle Waggle - Herbie Hancock\n2.Dorado - Blue Mitchell\n3.Knucklehead - Grover Washington Jr.\n4.Celestial Blues - Gary Bartz NTU Troop\n5.Blow Your Whistle - The Soul Searchers\n6.Getaway - Salsoul Orchestra\n7.Slippin' Into Darkness - Ramsey Lewis Trio\n8.Bad Bad Simba - Levy O'Donel\n9.Fat City Strut - Mandrill\n10.Nautilus - Bob James\n11.Right On - Clarence Wheeler And The Enforcers\n12.September 13 - Deodato","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bcda10b7d0ed0fcfe69e43b86ae2701dd6f6487","amp;dn":"Pulp+Fusion+-++The+Tough+Side+Vol+2+%5BMp3+192+Kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bcda10b7d0ed0fcfe69e43b86ae2701dd6f6487","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,205,161,11,125,14,208,252,254,105,228,59,134,174,39,1,221,111,100,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

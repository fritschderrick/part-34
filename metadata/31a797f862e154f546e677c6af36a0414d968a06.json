Two versions were released; a single disc version and a bonus disc version. On the front cover, the album title is imposed upon the seal of the demon Astaroth.  Disc 1 is a selection of songs from his previous solo albums, with the addition of two new songs, &quot;Broken&quot; and &quot;Silver Wings&quot;, both of which were written by Dickinson and guitarist/producer Roy Z. Disc 2 contains rare songs, most of which have appeared as b-sides on singles. The track &quot;The Voice of Crube&quot; is an explanation of the various songs, narrated by Bruce (for whom 'Crube' is an anagram).\n\n \n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Broken\n[02] Tattooed Millionaire\n[03] Laughing In The Hiding Bush (Live)\n[04] Tears Of The Dragon\n[05] The Tower\n[06] Born In '58\n[07] Accident Of Birth\n[08] Silver Wings\n[09] Darkside Of Aquarius\n[10] Chemical Wedding\n[11] Back From The Edge\n[12] Road To Hell\n[13] Book Of Thel (Live)\n\nCD01 Play Time - 01h:03m:32s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter\n[02] Darkness Be My Friend\n[03] Wicker Man\n[04] Real World\n[05] Acoustic\n[06] No Way Out...Continued\n[07] Midnight Jam\n[08] Man Of Sorrows\n[09] Ballad Of Mutt\n[10] Re-Entry\n[11] I'm In A Band With An Italian Drummer\n[12] Jerusalem\n[13] The Voice Of Crube\n[14] Dracula\n\nCD02 Play Time - 01h:11m:21s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 920mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................

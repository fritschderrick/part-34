The Irish are undefeated in five matches against Les Bleus, including a 24-9 victory in the group stage of 2015's World Cup. This game, against Guy Noves' new-look French side, will provide a stern test to Ireland's 2016 Six Nations credentials, and determine whether they can win three successive titles for the first time in Irish history. Joining Gabby in the studio are Keith Wood, Thomas Castaignede and Paul O'Connell. Match commentary comes from Eddie Butler and Brian Moore.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: h264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 7321Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 50i/MBAFF\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 384Kbps CBR 48KHz\r\nAudio Channels: 6\r\nRun-Time: 144 mins\r\nPart Size: 8.20 GB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nContainer: TS\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d7b61f1aa87b26d6ef5ab2574bd7aa883436433","amp;dn":"Six.Nations.Rugby.2016.02.13.France.v.Ireland.1080i.h264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d7b61f1aa87b26d6ef5ab2574bd7aa883436433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,123,97,241,170,135,178,109,110,245,171,37,116,189,122,168,131,67,100,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

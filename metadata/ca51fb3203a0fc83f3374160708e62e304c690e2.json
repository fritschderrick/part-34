Lizard, who has been playing Santa Claus professionally for over 20 years, shared some of his favorite memories, as well as observations. He's found that the true meaning of Christmas has to do with the spirit of generosity, where in some cases people make anonymous donations or gifts in the mode of a &quot;Secret Santa.&quot; Discussing his profound visits to children's hospitals, he said &quot;you don't ask a sick child what they want. All they want to do is get well and go home.&quot; He also talked about doing &quot;pajama visits,&quot; where he puts presents under the tree, and the children catch him in the act, but the parents hurry the children off to bed, before Santa sees them.\n\nThe rest of the evening featured Open Lines, with callers telling memorable Christmas stories, as well as holiday miracles. There were also a series of special guests phoning-in throughout the night, led off by George's mother, who remarked that the best Christmas gift is one that money can't buy. George's son Jonathan, and daughter Kristi also called in, along with Christian Wilde (a recording of his version of Oh Holy Night was played), Joshua P. Warren, Richard C. Hoagland &amp; Dr. Robin Falkov, and Dannion Brinkley. Lionel Fanthorpe's recording of Twas the Night Before Christmas, and a greeting from Pat Boone were also featured.\n\nNotorious caller J.C. shared his version of &quot;Christmas cheer&quot; with a frantic rant about Santa being an avatar of Satan (their names have the same letters). Santa is a slovenly pig gorging himself all night on cookies and milk, and he's stolen Jesus' birthday, J.C. declared before angrily hanging up.\n\nNews segment guests: Mitch Battros, Jeffrey Smith\nWebsite(s):\n\n    beingsantaclaus.com\n\nBook(s):\n\n    Being Santa Claus\n\nBumper Music\n\nBumper music from Monday December 24, 2012\n\n    Midnight Express (The Chase)\n    Giorgio Moroder\n\n    Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)\n    Elvis Presley\n\n    Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\n    Chicago\n\n    I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\n    John Mellencamp\n\n    Run Rudolph Run\n    Chuck Berry\n\n    Winter Wonderland\n    Johnny Mathis\n\n    A Holly Jolly Christmas\n    Burl Ives\n\n    Silver Bells\n    Olivia Newton-John\n\n    Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\n    Ella Fitzgerald\n\n    Let There Be Peace On Earth\n    Lyn Alejandrino Hopkins\n\n    O Little Town Of Bethlehem\n    Alabama\n\n    It Came Upon a Midnight Clear\n    Carpenters\n\n    Jingle Bells\n    Partridge Family\n\n    Happy Christmas\n    Andy Williams\n\n    Inca Dance\n    Cusco\n\n\nMerry Christmas to the entire Coast to Coast AM Family!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca51fb3203a0fc83f3374160708e62e304c690e2","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+December+24+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca51fb3203a0fc83f3374160708e62e304c690e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,81,251,50,3,160,252,131,243,55,65,96,112,142,98,227,4,198,144,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

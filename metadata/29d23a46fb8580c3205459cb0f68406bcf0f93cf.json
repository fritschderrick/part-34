EDWARDS is acknowledged as one of the best of Victorian ghost story writers. She was one of the select band of authors who was invited by Charles Dickens to contribute ghost stories to the Christmas numbers of his magazine ALL THE YEAR ROUND, and some of her talesÃ¢â‚¬â€such as 'The Four-fifteen Express', 'Number Three', 'My Brother's Ghost Story', and the highly influential 'The Phantom Coach'Ã¢â‚¬â€have become staples of ghost story anthologies.\n\nThere was much more to Amelia Edwards than ghost stories, however, as Richard Dalby makes clear in his introduction. She was an indefatigable traveller, and she incorporated much of what she observed into her ghost stories, many of which are set in northern and central Europe. She was also an archaeologist of work renown, who was instrumental in ensuring that the treasures and antiquities of ancient Egypt were properly excavated and preserved.\n\nTHE PHANTOM COACH is the first time that all of Amelia B. Edwards's supernatural fiction has been collected in one volume. In addition to all her known ghost stories, the volume also contains three additional items, including a delightful piece by Edwards herself about 'My Home Life': a fascinating look at one of the Victorian era's most fascinating women","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29d23a46fb8580c3205459cb0f68406bcf0f93cf","amp;dn":"The+Phantom+Coach+-+Amelia+B.+Edwards","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29d23a46fb8580c3205459cb0f68406bcf0f93cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,210,58,70,251,133,128,195,32,84,89,203,15,104,64,107,207,15,147,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

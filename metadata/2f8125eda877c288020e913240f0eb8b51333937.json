The film explores &quot;questions of identity, justice, beauty, meaning and death through the stories of an experimental photographer, an ailing monk and an enterprising stockbroker&quot;, played by Aida El-Kashef, Neeraj Kabi and Sohum Shah.\n\nAfter three years in development, the film premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, where it received great critical acclaim and was touted as &quot;the hidden gem of the year&quot;. It has received largely positive reviews from both Indian and international press and has been hailed as &quot;the most significant film to come out of India in a very long time&quot;.\n\nThe title of the film alludes to TheseusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ paradox, most notably recorded in Life of Theseus, wherein the Greek philosopher Plutarch inquires whether a ship that has been restored by replacing all its parts remains the same ship.\n\nThe film released in India on 19 July 2013.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f8125eda877c288020e913240f0eb8b51333937","amp;dn":"Ship+of+Thesues++%282012%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f8125eda877c288020e913240f0eb8b51333937","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,129,37,237,168,119,194,136,2,14,145,50,64,240,235,139,81,51,57,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

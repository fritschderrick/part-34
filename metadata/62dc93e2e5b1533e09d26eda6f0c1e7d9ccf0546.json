I did my best to find a correct translation but there is little information out there about this album and so I was left with Google. \n\nMP3/320\n\nAll MP3 tracks have ID3 tags for Album, Artist, Track Titles, and order in the album.  Some other information, such as Year, Genre, and Publisher may have been added if the information was available to me.\n\nFLAC cannot be encoded in a usable fashion with tags, so you must add them yourself. \n\nAll albums will have album art included if it was available to me.\n\nAll MP3 files that I upload are encoded at TRUE 320 kbps.\n\nAll FLAC files that I upload are encoded at highest quality.  If the files seem a little large, that is why. \n\nIf you have any problems, comments, or suggestions, let me know. \n\nEnjoy, and seed, Seed, SEED!

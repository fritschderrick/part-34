Betty (Brenda Blethyn) secretly loved Boris, but could not fight her father's wishes, so she was married off to a gold digger (Robert Pugh). Boris gave up his dreams and took over the family's undertaking business. Everything has remained status quo in their lives until Betty's mother-in-law dies. Boris and Betty are thrust together again and as they discuss the funeral arrangements for Betty's mother-in-law, the old spark is rekindled.\n\nHer funeral will be held at Plots Funeral Homes, much to the chagrin of rival funeral director, Frank Featherbed (Christopher Walken). Featherbed, an American, is determined to revolutionise the undertaking business in England through the innovation of &quot;theme&quot; funerals. Boris discovers that the only obstacle between their love for one another, is her marriage to the two-timing Mayor. In a desperate bid for happiness Boris and Betty decide to stage her death and run away together.\n\n\nLength: 93min\nCodec: XVID\nResolution: 640 * 272\nAudio: MP3 128kbit VBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1663ff7efe85c192279fdd11b4e1fa3841a675de","amp;dn":"Plots+with+a+View+%2F+Undertaking+Betty+%282002%29+%5BDVD-Rip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1663ff7efe85c192279fdd11b4e1fa3841a675de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,99,255,126,254,133,193,146,39,159,221,17,180,225,250,56,65,166,117,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The player's party can have up to six total companions, including the main hero, and they'll be recruited while exploring the world. The main character will be highly customizable and the player's choice of class, sex, race (and subrace), culture, traits, skills and appearance will give the character its own personal background.\n\n\n* enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8ecf4b8c4626d05e7445e047b777a8d000505b6","amp;dn":"Pillars+Of+Eternity+GOG+Multi7+-+32play.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8ecf4b8c4626d05e7445e047b777a8d000505b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,236,244,184,196,98,109,5,231,68,94,4,123,119,122,141,0,5,5,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

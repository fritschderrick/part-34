These are unreleased STUDIO recordings ONLY-- not alternate takes, remixes, BBC one-offs, or Andrew Oldham Orchestra recordings. Sources include:\n\nJWB's &quot;Unsurpassed Masters&quot;\nMidnight Beat's &quot;Satanic Sessions&quot;\nVarious Russian &quot;Fake Decca&quot; bootlegs\n\nI do not claim to have &quot;discovered&quot; these recordings. I simply compiled, sequenced, and made minor edits for playability. I also photoshopped the artwork, based on original photography by Gered Mankowitz. \n\nM3U playlist included. \n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caa3a199e6ab966a4c36154eaa835381cfbca19e","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Get+Yourself+Together%3A+1963+-+1970+%28Unrelea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caa3a199e6ab966a4c36154eaa835381cfbca19e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,163,161,153,230,171,150,106,76,54,21,78,170,131,83,129,207,188,161,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

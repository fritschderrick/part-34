Yet, he has only ever produced 3 albums, and his last real album was over 7 years ago. Where others of less talent, would produce new albums every 6 months or yearly, George evidentely can only release material when he has 'something to say'.\n\nFor many, George is the aspirational singer, songwriter. No one has ever combined such unique songwriting skills with such an emotive and addictive voice.\n\nIn many ways, this album contains tracks that are as good (Emotionally, Spiritually,) as can ever be produced, by anyone, anywhere.\n\nConsider this, George was only 17 when he wrote 'careless whisper', seems incredible how someone so young had the maturity and talent to write / compose such a timeless and effortless ballad.\n\nThere seems to be 2 types of people in life, those that will look at a product, and appreciate its qualities, regardless of fashion or what mass popularity dictates. Or those that can only follow the mainstream, and go along with whatever is popular, good or, more usually, the very bad indeed.\n\nSo, the title of this album is perfect, for me and many others, its without doubt one of the very, very finest peices of music ever recorded. For others, it contains G.Michael who was ultra popular with girls when in Wham! so they can never get seen even holding the cd.\n\nWhat does it take to change the essence of a man ?

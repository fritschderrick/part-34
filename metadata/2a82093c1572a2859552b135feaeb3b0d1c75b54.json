Das\nProduct Description\nThis revised and updated edition of Advanced Soil Mechanics presents a step-by-step guide to all aspects of the subject to students, and addresses a wide range of topics in a logical and extensively illustrated approach, including: grain-size distribution; the nature of water in clay; consistency of cohesive soils; weight-volume relationships; soil classification systems; concepts of elasticity; equations of equilibrium.\nThe book is illustrated with mathematical derivations and clear diagrams, problems and examples are provided throughout and each chapter concludes with a list of references for further in-depth review or research. Advanced Soil Mechanics is valuable not only for upper-level undergraduate and graduate level students of civil engineering, engineering mechanics, and soil mechanics, but also as a reference for professionals working in these fields.\n\nAbout the Author\nBraja M. Das was formerly Dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science, California State University, Sacramento.\n\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 600 pages\nPublisher: Spon Press; 3 edition (March 19, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0415420261\nISBN-13: 978-0415420266\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a82093c1572a2859552b135feaeb3b0d1c75b54","amp;dn":"Advanced+Soil+Mechanics+by+Braja+M.+Das","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a82093c1572a2859552b135feaeb3b0d1c75b54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,130,9,60,21,114,162,133,149,82,177,53,254,174,179,176,209,199,91,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

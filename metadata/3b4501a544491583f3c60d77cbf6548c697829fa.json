Now all subtitles (in this release) are properly positioned and colored\n(well, they are originally white, so no changes here actually). Also i changed\ndefault font from Arial to Arial Unicode MS (now you could see \\'2/8 notes\\'\ncharacters in the inro song subtitles!).      \nAlso, Russian tracks in this release are 100% dubbed (overral quality is better\nthan 2nd season). It\\'s a shame that translation itself is...well...far from\nperfect. And last (but not least) - slight changes in deinterlacing procedures.\nAs you probably know, Telecide() can\\'t always detect interlaced frames properly\nand could either deinterlace normal (not interlaced) frame, or do not deinterlace\ninterlaced frame. Both are bad. But for my taste later is less noticeable than\nfirst, so i tweaked parameters accordingly. Because of this you may see some\nframes (with small motion) not deinterlaced, but there will be less improperly\ndeinterlaced frames (usually they look like someone been chewing all horizontal\nand diagonal lines).\nBad news: only some (less than 50%) episodes features subtitles. Because there is\nno subtitles on the DVD.\n\nI\\'m planning to rip 4th season soon, so stay tuned!\nHowever, future of 5th (AKA Lost Season) is dark and murky. I do have access to\n5th season DVDs, but there is no Russian audio for it at the moment, and\nNinja Tribunal episode is nowhere to be found.\n\nTo rickw512: thanks for nothing. You delayed me,but you can\\'t stop me, mwa-ha-ha!\n\nThanks to:\n  DisneyJazz.net\n  Doom9.org\n  Audacity developers\n  Stax\nSpecial thanks to:\n  MaMaDx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b4501a544491583f3c60d77cbf6548c697829fa","amp;dn":"TMNT_2003_Season_03_x264_AAC_DVDRip_by_LRN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b4501a544491583f3c60d77cbf6548c697829fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,69,1,165,68,73,21,131,243,198,13,119,203,246,84,140,105,120,41,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

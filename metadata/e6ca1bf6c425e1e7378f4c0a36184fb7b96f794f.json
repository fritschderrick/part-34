(Use CD Overburn)\n\n&quot;Two sinister beings from another dimension come to Earth, but need a way home.&quot;\n\nThe series' fourth and final entry was directed by Jim Wynorski and made by CineTel Films and also released straight-to-video in 1994 by Columbia TriStar Home Video. Original Ghoulies lead Pete Liapis returned to the series as Jonathan Graves, now a detective who must deal with a new pair of Ghoulies. This entry in the series has been criticized by the fans of the series because the 'ghoulies' in this film are completely different than the other entries in the series. Instead of the usual puppet Ghoulies, the movie cast midget actors in miniature costumes. Ghoulies IV was released on DVD in 2007 by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment.\n\nXviD - 560x416 - 25fps - 1h 20mn 17s 760ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6ca1bf6c425e1e7378f4c0a36184fb7b96f794f","amp;dn":"Ghoulies+IV+%281994%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6ca1bf6c425e1e7378f4c0a36184fb7b96f794f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,202,27,246,196,37,225,231,55,143,76,10,54,24,79,183,185,111,121,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

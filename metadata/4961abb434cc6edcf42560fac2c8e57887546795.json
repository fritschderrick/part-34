(Horde and Alliance)\n\n\n\n\nInstall instructions: \n\n1) DO NOT USE THE OFFICIAL ZYGOR LAUNCHER FOR ANY REASON.\n\n2) Extract the .zip and drop the ZygorGuidesViewer folder into your WoW/Interface/Addons folder and overwrite the current installation.\n\n\nMac-Only install instructions:\n\n1) Put the ZygorGuidesViewer folder in Hard Drive/Applications/World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns.\n\n2) (Optional) Open World of Warcraft, login, click the Addons button on the Character Select Screen, make sure Zygor is selected, and check the &quot;Load out of date addons&quot; box. Some users have stated that this step is rarely/never necessary but it is here as a reference.\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\nREAD ME:\n\nThese uploads work just fine; if you are having problems it is on your end. That being said, if there does happen to be a problem with an upload, then fall back to the previous version and NICELY let me know... I'll fix it as soon as I can.\n\n\nPlease DO NOT post comments about new updates. I check daily for updates and if I haven't posted a new version yet, I'll get to it when I get to it. \n\n\nPlease DO NOT make addon requests. The two most popular guides are Zygor and Dugi, and those are the ones that will be uploaded. (I'm working on Dugi currently.)\n***********************************************************************************\n\n\nPatch notes:\n\n\n\nVersion: 4.0.6132\nReleased on: March 19th, 2013\n\n[B] General\nFixed general display issues with the modelviewer.\nRemoved certain unused cave steps.\n\n[B] Dailies/Reputations\nFixed issues with the 5.2 dailies.\n\n[B] Leveling\nFixed a reported issue with the Krasarang Wilds Leveling Guide\n\n[A] Dungeons\nFixed an error in the dungeon guide\n\n\n\nVersion: 4.0.6123\nReleased on: March 19th, 2013\n\n[B] Dailies/Reputations\nFixed errors in the 5.2 dailies and reputations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4961abb434cc6edcf42560fac2c8e57887546795","amp;dn":"Zygor+Guides+4.0.6132+%28March+19th%2C+2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4961abb434cc6edcf42560fac2c8e57887546795","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,97,171,180,52,204,110,220,244,37,96,250,194,200,229,120,135,84,103,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

All Shake has to do is deliver a package to Las Vegas and pick up a briefcase.\n\nOnly the package turns out to be a wholesome young housewife named Gina whose husband has run afoul of Dick Moby, aka &quot;The Whale,&quot; an unpleasant four-hundred-pound Vegas strip-club owner. Shake hates to think what's going to happen to Gina when he delivers her to The Whale, so in a move that's as noble as it is boneheaded, he decides to set her free.\n\nNow Shake and Gina are on the run to Panama, hoping to unload the very valuableÃ¢â‚¬â€and highly unusualÃ¢â‚¬â€contents of The Whale's briefcase. Shake could end up a rich man, but first he'll have to outmaneuver two angry crime bosses, a murderous Armenian thug plagued by erectile superfunction, a former pro football player who blames Shake for his romantic woes, and a billionaire swindler with a flair for the theatrical. Not to mention, and not the least, Shake will need to survive his own heart, since he's going to discover that wholesome housewife Gina is even more intriguing, and a lot more complicated, than he ever imagined.\n\nFull of blindsided double-crosses and hard shots to the head, Gutshot Straight is a tale of love, luck, and larceny against the odds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb70b11354e9d903cfba02db8a22423ed0ac7fa6","amp;dn":"Gutshot+straight+by+Lou+Berney+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb70b11354e9d903cfba02db8a22423ed0ac7fa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,112,177,19,84,233,217,3,207,186,2,219,138,34,66,62,208,172,127,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

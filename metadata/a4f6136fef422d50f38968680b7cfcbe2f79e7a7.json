As Myles Connolly wrote him, J. Blue was the man whom the ambitious Jay Gatsby might have become had he steered by a higher truth than the sound of money in Daisy Buchanan's voice.â€â€”from the introduction by John B. Breslin, S.J.J. Blue is a young man who decides to take Christianity seriously, not as a chore but as a challenge. He spends his inherited wealth almost as soon as he gets it. He lives in a packing box on a New York City rooftop. He embraces the poor as his best friends and wisest companions, distrusts the promises of technology (except for the movies), and is fascinated by anything involving the wide expanse of God's universe. He is the ultimate free spirit, it seems; but what is the sourceâ€”and purposeâ€”of his freedom? This novel about a contemporary St. Francis figure has delighted and inspired countless readers since it was first published in 1928.\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;I first read Blue when I was a young teenager, and the short novel's simplicity, purity, expression, and color all formed how I viewed the world for the rest of my teenage years. Like Christ, Blue.... who I believe manifests modern-day real-world Christianity, or perhaps even a contemporary St. Francis of Assisi imagery..... found God's colorful inspiration in the good and bad in the world that surrounded him. Its a shame that Mr. Blue has gone out of print, and over the years I've taken pleasure in hunting down, buying and gifting copies of this wonderful book. If only today's youth could be be inspired to love, laughter and service through a book as wonderful as Mr. Blue. If only today's adults could revel in making the wonderful dreams found in this book come alive....&quot; --Patrick A.\r\n\r\n&quot;I don't know how I got a hold of this book when I was between 8 and 10 years old, but I'm glad that I did. I lost this book many years ago (20+) but have never forgotten it's message, LOVE LIFE, because it's beautiful, not in spite of the bad, but sometimes because of the bad. If you can get your hands on this book, do so, you'll be glad you did.&quot; --M. Gallegos\r\n\r\n&quot;I was given this outstanding work as a gift by one of the most precious people that has ever touched my life. She told me that whenever we were together, Jay Blue kept popping into her head so she gave me my treasured copy. I've probably read the book 100 times and continually find peace, encouragement and delight. No author has ever had such a profound effect upon my life and those I love. Whatever the price - read it!&quot; --JoAnn F.\r\n\r\n&quot;This book was given to me by William Stringfellow, unquestionably the outstanding 20th century American theologian. Karl Barth called him that. Stringfellow was a laymen, a lawyer, and a prophet. His admiration for Jay Blue was exceeded only by his fidelity to Jesus Christ. Mr. Blue blew my mind. One of three best books I have read. I have no idea how my copy every left me. It's an incredible story about a sinful saint.&quot; --J. Schmidt\r\n\r\n&quot;I'm not ashamed to say that this book prompted my conversion to Christianity. If you read it, you will see why. I taught English literature for twenty years before I picked up this book in a dentist's office. I was immediately captivated. Then I was heartbroken. The next step for me? I decided to follow in his footsteps!&quot; --Phil S.\r\n\r\n&quot;I first read Mr. Blue in 1963. He changed my life. Myles Connolly's tale of one man who embraces life with a rare exuberance is so refreshing. Although written in 1928, this book refuses to die as successive generations pass on the story. Mr. J. Blue takes living what it means to be Christian seriously. Both funny and full of pathos, Mr.Blue is truly a Twentieth Century American classic.&quot; --G. Mark\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this media, please seed and purchase a physical copy to support the producers and share with family and friends. \r\n\r\nFor more Catholic ebooks, audiobooks, audio presentations, movies &amp; video, visit \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/catholicstuff/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4f6136fef422d50f38968680b7cfcbe2f79e7a7","amp;dn":"Myles+Connolly+-+Mr.+Blue+%28EPUB%2C+MOBI%2C+AZW3%2C+PDF%29+Catholic+Novel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4f6136fef422d50f38968680b7cfcbe2f79e7a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,246,19,111,239,66,45,80,243,137,104,104,11,124,252,190,47,121,231,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

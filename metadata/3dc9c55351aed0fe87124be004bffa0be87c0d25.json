For half a century, the meaning of the inscriptions, and even the language in which they were written, would remain a mystery.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dc9c55351aed0fe87124be004bffa0be87c0d25","amp;dn":"The+Riddle+of+the+Labyrinth%3A+The+Quest+to+Crack+an+Ancient+Code","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dc9c55351aed0fe87124be004bffa0be87c0d25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,201,197,83,81,174,208,254,135,18,75,224,4,191,250,11,232,124,13,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

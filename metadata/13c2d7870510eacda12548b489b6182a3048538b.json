In 1990, the band changed their name to Arcturus (meaning Bear Guardian), likely after the Behenian fixed star Arcturus.\n\nThe band released four official full-length albums. Arcturus has experimented throughout their career, extracting influences and incorporating elements from all over the musical spectrum including black metal and classical music, but the band was rooted as a metal outfit. On April 16, 2007, it was announced that the band would be breaking up, and more details were revealed in an official statement released on the band's website on April 17th.\n\nLa Masquerade Infernale (the title meaning &quot;the infernal masquerade&quot; in French) is a 1997 album by Arcturus. Released by Misanthropy Records, the album is a huge step away from the slow, doom-influenced melodic black metal of Aspera Hiems Symfonia. It has a dark, eerie, almost carnival sound to it, featuring heavy use of synthesizers and samples, often making those elements more prominent than the guitar. Most of the songs revolve around the themes of theater, literature, and Satan. The characteristic screams of black metal are replaced by a gruff, low-toned clean vocal style, occasionally alternated with operatic singing or the bizarre high-pitched singing of guest singer Simen HestnÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦s, who nine years later would replace Garm as the band's frontman\n\n\n\n1. &quot;Master of Disguise&quot;  6:43\n2. &quot;Ad Astra&quot;  7:36\n3. &quot;The Chaos Path&quot;  5:34\n4. &quot;La Masquerade Infernale&quot;  2:00\n5. &quot;Alone&quot;  4:42\n6. &quot;The Throne of Tragedy&quot; 6:34\n7. &quot;Painting My Horror&quot;  5:59\n8. &quot;Of Nails and Sinners&quot;  6:03\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13c2d7870510eacda12548b489b6182a3048538b","amp;dn":"ARCTURUS+-++La+Masquerade++Infernale+%5B1997%5D+%5BVBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13c2d7870510eacda12548b489b6182a3048538b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,194,215,135,5,16,234,205,161,37,72,180,137,182,24,42,48,72,83,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

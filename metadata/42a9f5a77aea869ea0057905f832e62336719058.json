This live set has the adventurous yet warm\nwordless vocals of Newton interacting closely with LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©andre's bass and sometimes\nher voice too. The nine improvisations have their scary and violent moments but\nin general are more accessible and witty than expected. Newton has a very\nflexible voice and LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©andre has the ability on bass to echo her ideas when she is\nnot challenging her. The results are quite stimulating.\n\nJoelle Leandre: Face It!; Lugano; At the Le Mans Jazz Festival &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=23978&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=23978&lt;/a&gt;\nBy Kurt Gottschalk\n\nDouble bassist JoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«lle LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©andre ranks right up there with Derek Bailey, Roscoe\nMitchell and Cecil Taylor as among the best of solo performers. Like them, she\nhas a developed, distinctive voice, an innate sense of logic and spontaneous\ncomposition and the talent to make each performance a new event. But LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©andre is\nalso a group player and seems to approach duos and ensembles not just with a\nsense of who she's playing with but for the size of the group. In a quartet, she\nnever fills more than 25% of the space, which isn't just a simple bit of math,\nit's a rare quality. And while she has a wealth of solo recordings, a few recent\nreleases show her as a compelling ensemble player.\n\nFace It! is the third disc LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©andre has made with American ex-pat vocalist Lauren\nNewton (after a previous duo, the excellent 18 Colors and Out of Sound with\nsaxophonist Urs Leimgruber). The recording, from the 2005 Le Mans Jazz Festival,\nshows their shared sensibilities. It starts a bit slow, but by 10 minutes in,\nthey're deep in shared consciousness, finding drama and humor with equal\nease. On top of her talent as a bassist, LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©andre is a powerful vocalist,\nalthough she makes sparing use of it. It's hard not to wait for her to match\nNewton's vocalese in kind, but they still pair off well for most of the set's 40\nminutes.\n\n[...]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42a9f5a77aea869ea0057905f832e62336719058","amp;dn":"Lauren+Newton+%26+Joelle+Leandre+-+Face+It%21+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42a9f5a77aea869ea0057905f832e62336719058","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,169,245,167,122,234,134,158,160,5,121,5,248,50,230,35,54,113,144,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

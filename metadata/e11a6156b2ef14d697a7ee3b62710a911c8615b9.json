Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuest: Robert Kelly\r\n\r\nEpisode 287: On todayâ€™s TACS a new grilled Anthony stresses the importance of brushing, we check in on the latest â€œblack lives matterâ€ rally, and Ant opens up as much as he can about the ups and downs of his life at this moment. He then gives a semi-review of the movies â€œThe Martianâ€ and â€œEverest,â€ we get familiar with some asshole named Wim Hof, go through a few holiday gifts, see a Ted Cruz holiday photo, read a news story about a shooting on Long Island, and discuss â€œsee something, say somethingâ€ on social media. Bobby Kelly joins the show to make â€œsmall talkâ€ about Antâ€™s weekend, his drinking, living his life backwards, and needing to find new fun, they then chat about inventive ways to defend yourself, holiday plans, the misconceptions of jail, jail dumps, juvi jail, and â€œrealâ€ jail. Ant talks about the media camping in front of his house, his neighbors, and being on the â€œDL,â€ the guys reminisce on ColecoVision, wax on new gaming, gaming chatter, kid cars, holiday weather, Bette Midlerâ€™s take on weather, living off the land, and being stank. Bobby brings up his obsession with knives, camping gone wrong, being afraid of the dark, and the homeless, Ant tells a story about getting lost in the woods, they talk about fear and instinct, sing some kid songs we wish we could un-hear, and they wrap up speaking on the selfishness of comics, insane kids, fat fuck karate masters, and Bobby attempts to give Ant dating advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e11a6156b2ef14d697a7ee3b62710a911c8615b9","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-12-23+Robert+Kelly+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e11a6156b2ef14d697a7ee3b62710a911c8615b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,26,97,86,178,239,20,214,151,167,238,59,98,113,10,145,28,134,21,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Thank you, Kevin, and please carry on with more.\nThis one&amp;#039;s a keeper....\n\nTracklist:\n1. Adoration\t \t\n2. Strength in Numbers\t\n3. Mother&amp;#039;s Love\t\n4. The Eternal Return\t\t\n5. Honoring Tradition\t\t\n6. Many Voices, One Spirit\t\t\n7. Atonement\t\n8. Reunion\t\n9. The Eternal Return (Ambient Mix)\t\t\n10.

However, there were many humans who wanted to live above the surface and they moved to land creating a fundamental separation between the two. After their school closes down, four 14-year-old middle school students from the sea village, Shioshishio, have to attend Mihama Middle School on the surface. What follows is their struggles to adjust to a new environment and the relationships between the sea and land people, while dealing with their own newfound feelings that have just started appearing with the end of their childhood.\n\nVideo\nVideo Source: Blu ray\nVideo Codec: H.264/AVC\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080p HD (16:9)\n\nAudio\nCodec: FLAC\nTrack 1: English Stereo\nTrack 2: Japanese Stereo\n\nSubtitles\nEnglish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c1df7a1477b6a22d1a88231d903925e6c0bed55","amp;dn":"Nagi+no+Asukara+1-26+%28BDRip+1920x1080p+FLAC+24-bit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c1df7a1477b6a22d1a88231d903925e6c0bed55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,29,247,161,71,123,106,34,209,168,130,49,217,3,146,94,108,11,237,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

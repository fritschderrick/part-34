The opening &quot;Worried Mind&quot; -- just Duster on harp, guitar, voice, high-hat and kick drum -- is a marvelously sloppy shuffle romp that holds its own with the Fabulous Thunderbirds' work ten years hence. On other tracks Bennett is backed by three-fourths of the original Fleetwood Mac, who provide simple, effective support without stealing any limelight; solos are kept to a minimum. Originals &quot;My Lucky Day&quot; (with chromatic harmonica) and &quot;Jumping at Shadows&quot; which Mac would later cover) are absolutely outstanding, and Duster does justice to Magic Sam's &quot;My Love Is Your Love.&quot; Dan Forte AMG\n\n\nTracklisting:\nA1.

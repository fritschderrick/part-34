The British are losing a bitter war against the Boers while the German kaiser is busy building a vast new navy. The United States is struggling to put down an insurgency in the South Pacific while the upstart imperialist Japan begins to make clear to neighboring Russia its territorial ambition. In China, a perennial pawn in the Great Game, a mysterious group of superstitious peasants is launching attacks on the Western powers they fear are corrupting their country. These ordinary ChineseÃ¢â‚¬â€called Boxers by the West because of their martial arts showmanshipÃ¢â‚¬â€rise up, seemingly out of nowhere. Foreshadowing the insurgencies of the more recent past, they lack a centralized leadership and instead tap into latent nationalism and deep economic frustration to build their army. Their battle cry: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Support the Qing, exterminate the foreigners.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMany scholars brush off the Boxers as an ill-conceived and easily defeated revolt, but the military historian David J. Silbey shows just how close they came to beating back the combined might of all the imperial powers. Drawing on the diaries and letters of allied soldiers and diplomats, Silbey paints a vivid portrait of the short-lived war.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0014d5cca0779624e70865e08afbb9e4942ab8a1","amp;dn":"The+Boxer+Rebellion+and+the+Great+Game+in+China","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0014d5cca0779624e70865e08afbb9e4942ab8a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,20,213,204,160,119,150,36,231,8,101,224,138,251,185,228,148,42,184,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

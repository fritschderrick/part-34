Granville's influence on generation after generation of artist cannot be over-estimated. It's truly incredible to me that everything in this book was created prior to 1847.

It's screaming for a giant coffee table version, and I totally want a print of that image up there with the turtle dog. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'Another World'\n\nAlthough I'm sure it says, I'm not sure exactly who the publisher was.

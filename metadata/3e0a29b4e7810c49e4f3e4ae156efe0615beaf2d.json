Remote and mysterious, this little-known region of towering peaks and precipitous escarpments is home to over half of all Madagascar's unique species.\n\nNarrated by David Attenborough, this second episode showcases an amazing collection of wildlife, many of which have never before been filmed. Cyanide-eating lemurs, cannibalistic frogs, meat-eating plants, cryptic leaf-tailed geckos, tadpole-eating wasps, tunnel-digging chameleons and house-proud flycatchers are just some of the weird and wonderful wildlife featured in this programme.\n\nAlong this coast, every cliff and valley is like a lost world where nature has run riot. Amongst the boulders of the Andringitra Highlands, a few hardy troops of ringtailed lemurs make their home. More at home in the hot southern forests, these eke out a living at the top of the coldest mountain on the island. To fight the sub-zero cold, they have developed thick coats and can only survive the freezing nights by huddling together in rocky crevices. In this high 'desert', they must eat cacti for moisture.\n\nDescend just a few hundred metres and it's a very different world, where dense forests are permanently shrouded in clouds. The Marojejy Massif is the last sanctuary of one of Madagascar's rarest lemurs, the elusive, ghostly white silky sifaka. There are thought to be only two hundred of these playful and endearing creatures left on earth.\n\nSource: BBC-HD\n\n\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (1280*720)\nVCodec: x264 from AVC in TS\nAudio: AC3 2ch 192Kbps in TS\n\nHD downsized/resized: 1920*1080i to 1280*720p\n\nFlawless encoding\n\nPls help seed to keep torrent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e0a29b4e7810c49e4f3e4ae156efe0615beaf2d","amp;dn":"BBC-HD+Madagascar+2+-+Lost+Worlds+x264+AC3+720p.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e0a29b4e7810c49e4f3e4ae156efe0615beaf2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,10,41,180,231,129,12,73,228,243,228,174,21,110,254,6,21,190,175,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

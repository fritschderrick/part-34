Read it.&quot; Amazon.com customer review &quot;The Microphone Book will save you time and money, even if you only ever buy one microphone to use in a home studio. If you do live sound, record on location, or are kitting out a slightly more ambitious project studio, then this book will be invaluable. It takes you far further than the 'microphone' sections of general guides to studio recording.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08d1e620ffd1739ccb6d50376e189d57795f1d37","amp;dn":"The+Microphone+Handbook.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08d1e620ffd1739ccb6d50376e189d57795f1d37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,209,230,32,255,209,115,156,203,109,80,55,110,24,157,87,121,95,29,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

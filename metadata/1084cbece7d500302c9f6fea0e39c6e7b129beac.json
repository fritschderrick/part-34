Although I subscribe to several alt music magazines and get my weekly EW, I was not aware of these releases until quite recently when BOL sent out an email flyer about their NY gig to promote the reissues. Any re-release is a &quot;good&quot; release in my opinion; it brings awareness to new collecters and music enthusiasts. Not to mention the material is re-mastered; 'loud' isn't always for the better, I don't have to turn the music level on my iPod higher when listening to these newer BOL releases.\r\n\r\nI do agree with some reviewers, the packaging could have been better, with a booklet showcasing all of the LP artwork; singles; etcetera; the historical write-up for all four reissues is informative and fantastic though. At least the Amazon track listing is correct for this album. I remember being extremely confused about the direction of BOL with this release, maybe a little let-down after the masterpiece that is &quot;Lullaby&quot;, but there are quite a few gems on this album, and is a cohesive story, getting better with age.\r\n\r\nFor the third BOL album, although production costs may have been higher, I wish the disc had been 'enhanced CD' and contained the &quot;Alice Everyday&quot; music video, I would have loved to have seen the band members playing their instruments in that snow-globe getting shook around again. The last two BOL releases, as well as &quot;Lullaby&quot;, should also have contained a second, supplement disc of extras. The version of &quot;Quiver&quot; (Extended) is sorely missed from the track listing; extremely happy &quot;Alice Everyday&quot; (Sam The Butcher Mix) found its way on the disc, a much darker, and playful version of the original song.\r\n\r\nHad I been in charge of this reissue and disc compilation, here's what the extended track listing or additional disc listing would have been; maybe an iTunes Playlist:\r\n\r\nDisc 2:\r\n01. Alice Everyday (Sunshine Day Edit)\r\n02. Counting The Rosaries (Single Remix)\r\n03. Sunny Day (2001 Version) [from the 2001 Best Of album]\r\n04. Quiver (Extended Mix)\r\n05. Alice Everyday (Sam The Butcher Edit)\r\n06. Counting The Rosaries (Insomnia Mix)\r\n07. Alice Everyday (Everday-Glo Edit)\r\n08. Counting The Rosaries (Partial Confession Mix)\r\n09. Sunny Day (Heal Your Positive Body Mix)\r\n10. Alice Everday (Sunshine Day Mix)\r\n11. Counting The Rosaries (Crying Angels Mix)\r\n12. Counting The Rosaries (Full Confession Mix)\r\n\r\nExtremely excited about these reissues and ANY BOL release.[/quote]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/NxIksEDLMg.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n Book of Love - Candy Carol (Sire 9 26389)\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nArtist...............: Book of Love\r\nAlbum................: Candy Carol (Sire 9 26389)\r\nGenre................: Pop\r\nSource...............: CD\r\nYear.................: 1991 04\r\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\r\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\r\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\r\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 62 %)\r\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n Tracklisting\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n 1.

I started out to write a logical, sequential set of guidelines and ideas that would provide a detailed road map for those just starting their journey. Yet as I thought and wrote, I realized that there is no one road map. Your journey will be different from mine. It will be a unique experience based on your own beliefs and philosophies. I can only write about what has worked for me. Take what you like and leave the rest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f7d6520fb0472ba2535e554397f8d3d3a67a156","amp;dn":"Developing+Students%5C%27+Multiple+Intelligences+-+K+to+8.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f7d6520fb0472ba2535e554397f8d3d3a67a156","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,125,101,32,251,4,114,186,37,53,229,84,57,127,141,61,58,103,161,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

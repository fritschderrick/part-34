Mr. Irving currently sits in a Austrian jail on the basis of thought crimes. Read about why here: http://www.rense.com/general69/zattk.htm\n\nYou may or may not like Irving's research, but I will continue to upload his lectures solely on the basis of his imprisonment on thought crimes. And that is the end of it. I stand up for the little guy and free speech, and the &quot;little guy&quot; is most DEFINETLY not an orwellian police state, ridled with thought-criminals and apathetic morons, who simply turn a blind eye to such incredible meassures. You will moste definetly get what you deserve if you do so. \n\nFeel free to whine about it, and leave your hysterical, malicious, hateful, filthy and abusive comments below if you would like (I know some would like that very much), but do not expect me to take them seriously, much less read them. \n\n***This is a repair job***\n\nSource specs:\nFilesize.....: 452 MB (or 463,296 KB or 474,415,104 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:13:23 (66,053 fr)\nVideo Codec..: DivX 5.0\nVideo Bitrate: 770 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: PCM Audio\nAudio Bitrate: 88 kb/s, monophonic\nFrame Size...: 320x240 (1.33:1) [=4:3]\n\nVideo: Noise reduced.\nAudio: Audio sync problem fixed and noise reduced.\n\nNew specs: \nFilesize.....: 225 MB (or 230,882 KB or 236,423,168 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:13:23 (66,052 fr)\nVideo Codec..: DivX 5.0\nVideo Bitrate: 402 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: mpeglayer3 (mp3) (0x0055) ISO/MPEG\nAudio Bitrate: 24 kb/s, monophonic\nFrame Size...: 320x240 (1.33:1) [=4:3]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1dfdb914be3f9fe719ab3facb9fb6da04a630e7","amp;dn":"David+Irving+%26+Tony+Martin+-+The+Trade+In+African+Slaves","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1dfdb914be3f9fe719ab3facb9fb6da04a630e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,223,219,145,75,227,249,254,113,154,179,250,203,159,182,218,4,166,48,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

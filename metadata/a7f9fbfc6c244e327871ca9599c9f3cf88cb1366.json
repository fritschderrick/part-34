Pryor (Jones and Bartlett, 2011).pdf\n\nISBN 978-0-7637-7999-3\n\nMultiphysics Modeling Using COMSOLÃ‚Â® rapidly introduces the senior level undergraduate, graduate or professional scientist or engineer to the art and science of computerized modeling for physical systems and devices. It offers a step-by-step modeling methodology through examples that are linked to the Fundamental Laws of Physics through a First Principles Analysis approach. The text explores a breadth of multiphysics models in coordinate systems that range from 1D to 3D and introduces the readers to the numerical analysis modeling techniques employed in the COMSOLÃ‚Â® MultiphysicsÃ‚Â® software. After readers have built and run the examples, they will have a much firmer understanding of the concepts, skills, and benefits acquired from the use of computerized modeling techniques to solve their current technological problems and to explore new areas of application for their particular technological areas of interest","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7f9fbfc6c244e327871ca9599c9f3cf88cb1366","amp;dn":"Multiphysics+Modeling+Using+COMSOL%26reg%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7f9fbfc6c244e327871ca9599c9f3cf88cb1366","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,249,251,252,108,36,78,50,120,113,202,149,153,201,243,207,136,203,19,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

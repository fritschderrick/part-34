It has a clean loading screen!\nUse this to activate Windows Vista Service Pack 1 / RTM x86 and x64 editions, using 15 different Bios emulations plus 18 official OEM Logos for Windows Vista.\n\nSupports:\n\n    * Windows Vista Home Basic\n    * Windows Vista Home Premium\n    * Windows Vista Business\n    * Windows Vista Ultimate\n    * Windows Vista Enterprise (Use the NO LOGO button).\n\n\n\nIf you use the NO LOGO button, Vista will be activated with ASUS emulation\nwithout OEM LOGOS.\n\nClick on the Brand you want, wait the confirmation message and reboot;\nYou can view the Vista activation status by clicking the GENUINE logo;\n\n\nUnable To Activate Vista??\nWell look no further!\n\nOk this is for people whose windows vista shows a product key in system information, but is not activated. It is likely that this will work for you when no other cracks do!\nI had this problem and tried many things to fix it (reinstalled vista 7 times), which i eventually did. It was caused by the old invalid product key remaining from my old vista installation (i have no idea how the key stayed there even though i formatted my entire drive, but i mean cmon its microsoft!)\n\nOk heres how we do it.\nDownload this file.\nCode:\n\nRun the crack, and ONLY click install key. Wait (may take a few minutes) until you recieve a message saying product key installed successfully, then exit the program.\nDO NOT REBOOT.\n\nDownload this file.\nCode:\n\nRun the crack, choosing any OEM logo emulator.\nWait for the confirmation that is is done, then exit the crack and reboot.\n\nAlternate\nIf you have tried the other method and still no joy, well here is the ultimate solution.\nJust download this file, extract it and then run installer menu (compiled by me) and follow the onscreen instructions.\nCode:\n\n\n\n_________________\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeedd86735587144cff0d0e0399a8c8cd5aa6142","amp;dn":"Vista+Loader+v3.0.0.1+Clean+Bios+Emulation+Loader","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeedd86735587144cff0d0e0399a8c8cd5aa6142","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,237,216,103,53,88,113,68,207,240,208,224,57,154,140,140,213,170,97,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

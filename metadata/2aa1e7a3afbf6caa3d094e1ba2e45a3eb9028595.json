In the UK, it failed to chart upon its original release, but after &quot;Grace Kelly&quot; topped the charts in January 2007, it managed to peak at #67 on the UK Downloads Chart because of download sales. The song makes use of a melody line from the Cutting Crew hit single &quot;(I Just) Died in Your Arms&quot;. Greek singer Tamta sang a remixed version of the song at the MAD Music Videos Awards. In North America, it was released as the third single from the album. The song was released as Mika's sixth single in the UK in stores on 31 December 2007, and for digital download on 24 December 2007 as a double A-side with &quot;Lollipop&quot;. This single peaked at number 18 in the UK Singles Chart. The song was also featured prominently in the movie &quot;Were the World Mine&quot;. It is also in the 2011 film &quot;Monte Carlo&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aa1e7a3afbf6caa3d094e1ba2e45a3eb9028595","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+512","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aa1e7a3afbf6caa3d094e1ba2e45a3eb9028595","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,161,231,163,175,191,108,170,61,9,78,27,162,228,90,62,185,2,133,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

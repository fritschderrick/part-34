Throughout the book the blend of fantasy and reality in this world is seen through the eyes of the sculptorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s daughter: the mysterious darkness behind her fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sacks of plaster, the sounds of a balalaika party in his studio, the great storms that blow in from the sea, the illuminated iceberg and the stone that will make the whole family rich, are all part of the reality of the childÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s experience of life. From these rich \nmemories of her childhood, Tove Jansson creates a series of fascinating vignettes\n\nSculptorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Daughter is truly a book that is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“suitable for all agesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. With great \ndelicacy she hints at the limits of the childÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s understanding and allows the child herself to use her own native intelligence in finding explanations for her own experiences. \n\nThese days, this book is almost impossible to get hold of and although about 50% of it was reprinted in the Winter Book this does remain as Jansson's major autobiographical work. A lot of work went into getting this PDF version up so if you do grab a copy, please seed as long as you can. I can't see this being hugely popular but the people who will want it will appreciate it I hope.\n\nIf you enjoyed this torrent please leave a comment. I am curious about how many people are interested in this plus it may motivate me to scan some of my other rarer books.\n\nEnjoy! _H*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09336fefef16092cf095bf03114855274ea66b41","amp;dn":"Tove+Jansson+-+Sculptors+Daughter+%28Autobiogaphy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09336fefef16092cf095bf03114855274ea66b41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,51,111,239,239,22,9,44,240,149,191,3,17,72,85,39,78,166,107,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

We trust, that you will find, by using thinkingParticles 3.0, that you will be able to create all the incredible effects that you have always wanted to create, but until now, have not been able to, due to very limited existing technologies.\n\nThe real power of thinkingParticlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ 3.0 comes from its unlimited combination of conditions and operators that define the behavior of each single particle in a particle system. Like C++, thinkingParticles opens up an unlimited world for a software developer. thinkingParticlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ offers the same unlimited power to the 3ds Max and 3ds Max Design artist.\n\nWhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the real deal with thinkingParticles 3.0?\n\nThinkingParticles 3.0 offers its particle system functionality through a kind of programming approach. \n\nHowever, unlike programming, you wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to write a single line of code!\n\nA powerful visual &quot;Wire Setup InterfaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ enables any 3ds Max artist to define the rules and conditions that control the particle behavior. Because it is a &quot;programÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that controls the particles and the behavior, you will find that there is no limit to what you can do! Nearly every particle effect can be created or controlled through a set of operators and conditions.\n\n\n\n\n1. Instal IP-clamp 1.2, *DO NOT REBOOT* and *DO NOT EXECUTE IT*!\n\n2. Fire our keygen, press Crack and pick Cebas/Ip-clamp dir.\n   (only the public crypto key will be patched)\n\n3. Now you can reboot and make sure ipclamp service is running.\n\n4. Launch IP-Clamp.exe and choose 'localhost' as primary network adapter, apply.\n\n4. Create a request file using your personnal informations\n   and a licence code generated by our keygen.\n\n5. Use keygen to generate a valid licence ipclamp.lic from this request.\n   Save the lic where except in IPClamp's dir (otherwise you won't\n   be able to import the it).\n\n6. Import your licence in IP-Clamp.\n\n7. Install every Cebas plug-ins you need.\n\n\nEnjoy it!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:771ec7979c2a3d603c1d297b91ac6b745277be41","amp;dn":"Cebas+ThinkingParticles+3.0+SP2+-+3Ds+Max+2011+x32+x64","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"771ec7979c2a3d603c1d297b91ac6b745277be41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,30,199,151,156,42,61,96,60,29,41,123,145,172,107,116,82,119,190,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

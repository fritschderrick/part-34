A clear presentation of the fundamental concepts of perspective and the reasons for its effectiveness, drawing on the latest laboratory research on how people perceive, leads into the development of a new theory to explain why Renaissance artists such as Leonardo and Mantegna used perspective in unorthodox ways which have puzzled art scholars. This theory illuminates the author's broader consideration of the evolution of art: the book proposes a resolution of the debate between those who believe that the invention/discovery of perspective is a stage in the steady progress of art and those who believe that perspective is merely a conventional and arbitrary system for the representation of space.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf4df2f13f6f13f7be6474a1a8c86d59dcbf8f62","amp;dn":"The+Psychology+of+Perspective+and+Renaissance+Art+%28Art+Ebook%29.pd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf4df2f13f6f13f7be6474a1a8c86d59dcbf8f62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,77,242,241,63,111,19,247,190,100,116,161,168,200,109,89,220,191,143,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

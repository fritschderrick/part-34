Blasting rocks to make way for new settlements on Tyrian seemed like a quiet life, but your long-time Huzundra friend is now dead - bless his lizard hide. Murdered! And obviously Microsol, the Terraforming company wants you dead too! It's that huge new rock formation you and Buce uncovered - it's Gravitium, and it's priceless. Tyrian is the only planet where it exists in commercial quantities, and Microsol are determined to control it. You can expect them to throw all their resources against you - and they won't pull any punches.\n\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ef02ef822b2c81e9897c40894afc56e3c1e7fcb","amp;dn":"Tyrian+2000+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ef02ef822b2c81e9897c40894afc56e3c1e7fcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,240,46,248,34,178,200,30,152,151,196,8,148,175,197,110,60,30,127,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

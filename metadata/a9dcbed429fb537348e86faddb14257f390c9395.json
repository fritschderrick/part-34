Rush foreshadowed it in 2010 by releasing &quot;BU2B,&quot; and &quot;Caravan&quot; to radio. The next single, &quot;Headlong Flight,&quot; didn't appear until 2012. Co-produced with Nick Raskulinecz (who also worked on 2007's Snakes &amp; Arrows), Clockwork Angels is a return to the concept album by the band that perfected it on 2112 in 1976. It centers on a loose narrative about a young man following his dreams. He struggles with inner and outer forces of order and chaos; he encounters an expansive world where colors, images, territories, and characters are embodied by pirates, strange carnivals, rabble-rousing anarchists, and lost cities.\n\n\n Clockwork Angels is the eagerly awaited 20th studio recording by legendary rock trio, Rush. The band is ranked third only behind The Beatles and The Rolling Stones for most consecutive gold or platinum studio albums by a rock band. Produced by GRAMMYÃ‚Â® Award winner Nick Raskulinecz, the album marks the first release by the ensemble since their acclaimed 2007 work, Snakes and Arrows. This complex concept album features a young manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s encounter with lost cities, exotic carnivals, pirates and a relentless watchmaker. The first single entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Headlong FlightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ debuted at #1 on classic rock radio and is quickly climbing the mainstream charts. Clockwork Angels is sure to please the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legion of adoring fans.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01. Caravan\n 02. BU2B\n 03. Clockwork Angels\n 04. The Anarchist\n 05. Carnies\n 06.

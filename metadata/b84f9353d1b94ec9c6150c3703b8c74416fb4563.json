This means there was no cropping so you may see small black bars around the picture's edge. This is exactly what is seen on the DVD source. The problem with cropping MST3Ks is that cropping based on the movie usually over-crops the SOL segments, sometimes a lot. Plus, automatically cropping can pull the picture out of its correct aspect ratio. So these encodes have no cropping, RF=20 constant quality video and AC3 passthru so the audio is identical to the DVD.\n\nHandbrake 0.10.1.6962 20150308\n\nVideo: AVC encode\nWidth 720, Anamorphic Loose, Copping Manual 0 0 0 0\nDeinterlace=Slower\nFPS 29.97 Constant, Preset=Very Slow, Quality RF=20.0\nAudio: AC3 Passthru 192Kbps\n\nMerlinsShopOfMysticalWonder.Vol05.DVDrip-brighter.mkv had special encoding parameters to make the picture slightly brighter:\nffmpeg version N-71544-g82d9c4e 20150420\nbrightness=0.1 (range -1.0 to 1.0, default 0.0)\nPreset=Very Slow, Quality RF=20.0\nAC3 Passthru\nCLI: ffmpeg -i merlin.mpeg -vf &quot;yadif,eq=1:0.1&quot; -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 20.0 -c:a copy merlin.mkv\n\nSingle = RHINO Solo\nShout = SHOUT Solo\nVol01 to Vol12 = RHINO Volume\nVol13+ = SHOUT Volume\ntitles with subs have them set off by default\nall titles have chapters\na = Season 10 in the filenames\n\nBytes.........SEp.[Title].[Volume#|Single].DVDrip.[~subs].mkv\n1,409,686,645 a01.Soultaker.Vol14.DVDrip.mkv\n1,232,784,198 a02.GirlInGoldBoots.Shout.DVDrip.mkv\n1,086,494,542 a03.MerlinsShopOfMysticalWonder.Vol05.DVDrip-brighter.mkv\n1,130,136,266 a04.FutureWar.Vol13.DVDrip.mkv\n1,461,014,023 a05.BloodWatersOfDrZ.Vol17.DVDrip.mkv\n..888,645,003 a06.BoggyCreekIIAndTheLegendContinues.Vol05.DVDrip.mkv\n1,218,967,540 a08.FinalJustice.Vol14.DVDrip.mkv\n..920,327,689 a09.Hamlet.Vol04.DVDrip.mkv\n1,016,176,842 a10.ItLivesByNight.Vol30.DVDrip.subs.mkv\n1,211,246,386 a11.HorrorsOfSpiderIsland.Vol11.DVDrip.mkv\n1,235,983,428 a12.Squirm.Vol31.DVDrip.subs.mkv\n\nBig thanks to the online MST3K community for the DVD sources, some of which are out of print or hard to find.

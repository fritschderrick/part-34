Who do you think it could be?\n\nOne thing is certain: there are plenty of surprises in store when My Kitchen Rules launches in 2013.\n\nManu Feildel and Pete Evans return to host and judge the ultimate home-cooking battle as they accept dinner party invites in each state across the country.\n\nThis series they welcome new guest judge Colin Fassnidge to the table alongside returning guest judges Guy Grossi, Karen Martini and Liz Egan.\n\nIt's state versus state, plate against plate, as teams of two attempt to out-dine and out-wine each other to see whose kitchen rules.\n\nEach team will take turns to transform an ordinary home into an instant restaurant for one pressure cooker night. They'll serve up a three course menu designed to impress not only their fellow contestants but our esteemed judges.\n\nThere will be triumphs, kitchen fires, laughter, tears and plenty of opinionated guests as they battle the clock and their nerves to plate up on time.\n\nThe top two teams will again battle it out in the grand final where they will present their ultimate dining menu to a full restaurant.\n\nWith $250,000 in prize money on offer, the knives will definitely be out.\n\nGatecrashers - Best friends\n\nGrowing up with few luxuries, good food was at the heart of happy family life for these two from Cabramatta in SydneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s west.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have much, not a lot of money, but my parents always made sure we had good, wholesome food,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Sophia. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We really couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have much else but there was always a fresh cooked meal every day. It was the one way they could nourish and show us love.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nFood, says Sophia, also has the ability to transport you back in time. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You can remember what the weather was, what you wore when you ate something. I remember these polka dot MC Hammer pantsÃ¢â‚¬Â¨ I was wearing, it was raining and my mum made this particular dish,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she says.\n\nSophiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family is from Cambodia and AshleeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s from Vietnam. Ã¢â‚¬Â¨They grew up in SydneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hub of South East Asian life, Cabramatta. The girls have been best friends since they sat next to each other on their first day of kindergarten.\n\nSophia, 29, is now doing a communications degree at Griffith University, while Ashlee, 28, is involved in blogging and photography.\n\nAshlee has been married for five years to American born Matthew, while Sophia is Ã¢â‚¬Å“single and ready to mingleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. But she admits she and her Ã¢â‚¬Å“crazy hilariousÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ friend have a bond thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to come between.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“With any great partnership itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the yin and the yang. Like I always say to Ashlee, I swear weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re like the Olsen twins. We just know what the other is gonna do or think. We definitely have this connection that is cosmic.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ash and I are true to ourselves,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she adds. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We get an idea in our mind and we follow it through and if it pans out great; if it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, well, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re fearless.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAdds Ashlee: Ã¢â‚¬Å“My friends would say IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m very straightforward and honest. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sugarcoat things. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see the point in making people feel better and not having them get the message.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe girls love to throw dinner parties together and say their style of cooking is distinctly Australian. Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Australian girls at the end of the day and when you think about Australian cuisine, it encompasses everything from Asian to French,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Sophia.\n\nPlus Ashlee loves to cook American for her husband. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I love to make corn bread. A bit of Spanish Ã¢â‚¬Â¨and Mediterranean. I like to cook everything.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨I try to mix it up.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nAnd they say the beauty of living in CabramattaÃ¢â‚¬Â¨is the availability of great produce. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cabramatta Ã¢â‚¬Â¨has cleaned up so well, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a tourist destination,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Ashlee. Ã¢â‚¬Å“There are food tours. But the mythÃ¢â‚¬Â¨has stuck to the name and it annoys me. The drug problems were in the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ90s. The people of Cabramatta have come so far. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like people to see us and understand that.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e54d860f109484440edabfc5a8b51d13c326baf","amp;dn":"My.Kitchen.Rules.AU.S04E18.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e54d860f109484440edabfc5a8b51d13c326baf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,84,216,96,241,9,72,68,64,237,171,252,90,139,81,209,60,50,107,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

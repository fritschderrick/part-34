Set in 1941, it stars John Turturro in the title role as a young New York City playwright who is hired to write scripts for a movie studio in Hollywood, and John Goodman as Charlie, the insurance salesman who lives next door at the run-down Hotel Earle. The Coens wrote the screenplay in three weeks while experiencing difficulty during the writing of another movie, Miller's Crossing. Soon after Miller's Crossing was finished, the Coens began filming Barton Fink, and it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1991. In a rare sweep, it won the Palme d'Or prize, as well as awards for Best Director and Best Actor (Turturro). Although it was celebrated almost universally by critics, the movie only grossed $6,000,000 at the box office ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ two-thirds of its estimated budget.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:940e1806052d49bb0e2cb16e6b294fc5ca799451","amp;dn":"Barton+Fink","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"940e1806052d49bb0e2cb16e6b294fc5ca799451","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,14,24,6,5,45,73,187,14,44,177,110,107,41,79,197,202,121,148,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

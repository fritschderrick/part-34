Topics raised include does Dennis recall the Rodney King riots,\n what do you wear at a Bar Mitzvah, why do some items make the news and others donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, is great art amoral.\n\n\n\nPrager 20120427  2 Happiness Hour Trusting\n\nPrager H2  If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not willing to trust people, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very hard to be happy. The risk/reward ratio is usually in favor\n of trusting.\n\n\n\nPrager 20120427  1 Transforming\n\nPrager H1   Why did people cheer wildly when candidate Obama told them that America should be Ã¢â‚¬Å“transformedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½?Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ \n Is the Commander-in-Chief also a political Intimidator-in-Chief? Does the Administration have an Ã¢â‚¬Å“enemyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s listÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½?.. \n The Labor Department issued an order banning children from doing farm work, but today had to reverse themselves. \n Does the Left have a clue how the middle of the country lives and thinks?Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one thing to lead from the rear, \n but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s another thing not to lead at all. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing in Syria. Nothing.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88536e423d7b329de3b12c11aa6986c46f669e0f","amp;dn":"The+Dennis+Prager+Radio+Show+APR-27-2012+FRI+CF+64K+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88536e423d7b329de3b12c11aa6986c46f669e0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,83,110,66,61,123,50,157,227,177,44,17,170,105,134,196,111,102,158,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

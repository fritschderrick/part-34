With his deep, resonant baritone and spare percussive guitar, he had a basic, distinctive sound. Cash didn't sound like Nashville, nor did he sound like honky tonk or rock &amp; roll. He created his own subgenre, falling halfway between the blunt emotional honesty of folk, the rebelliousness of rock &amp; roll, and the world-weariness of country. Cash's career coincided with the birth of rock &amp; roll, and his rebellious attitude and simple, direct musical attack shared a lot of similarities with rock. However, there was a deep sense of history -- as he would later illustrate with his series of historical albums -- that kept him forever tied with country. And he was one of country music's biggest stars of the '50s and '60s, scoring well over 100 hit singles. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.80% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tSony/BMG\nCatalog:\t\tA 705279\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Ring Of Fire\n02.Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down\n03.I Walk The Line\n04.Folsom Prison Blues\n05.Understand Your Man\n06.Big River\n07.I Still Miss Someone\n08.Jackson (With June Carter)\n09.A Boy Named Sue (Live)\n10.One Piece At A Time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:422119b335df42fd37d613ece932655c80e703a0","amp;dn":"Johnny+Cash+-+Super+Hits+%282007%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"422119b335df42fd37d613ece932655c80e703a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,33,25,179,53,223,66,253,55,214,19,236,233,50,101,92,128,231,3,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

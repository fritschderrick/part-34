They&amp;#039;re old Fisher-Price/Spellbinder tapes I grew up with. I couldn&amp;#039;t find these ANYWHERE to download on the net, so I painstakingly acquired several stories (I happened to get lucky on eBay) and digitized them via my PlusDeck2c. I encoded these at 320kbps for as best quality as I could get. If you don&amp;#039;t like the huge file sizes, re-encode them after you download. I also made a Christmas Story Collection with various children&amp;#039;s Christmas stories I grew up with. Also included in the torrent are the album art files that I lightscribed to the CDs. Below is a list of the stories:\n\n1. Tom Sawyer\n\n2. Rip Van Winkle/Gulliver&amp;#039;s Travels\n\n3. George Washington\n\n4. The American Revolution\n\n5. Mickey&amp;#039;s Christmas Carol\n\n6. Frosty the Snowman\n\n7. Frosty&amp;#039;s Winter Wonderland\n\n8. The Night Before Christmas\n\n9. The Chipmunks Santa Harry\n\n10. Christmas with the Chipmunks (1990)\n\nIt works great to burn the stories by themself in audio format and then add the mp3 files as a cd extra so the recipient of the cd doesn&amp;#039;t have to rip the cd; they can simply move the mp3 files (which, btw are all tagged nicely) over to the computer. \n\nIf you have any of the other Fisher-Price/Spellbinder tapes, please PM me and maybe we can work something out to get me a copy so I can digitize those as well. I&amp;#039;d like to get Daniel Boone/Ben Franklin, Four Fairy Tales, The Wizard of Oz, and Hans Brinker. Let me know if you have those!\n\nALSO, PLEASE HELP SEED THIS TORRENT!!! I&amp;#039;ll be moving and unable to seed for awhile.\n\nNote: The American Revolution has two tracks 16. The longer one has a &quot;hidden track&quot; I built into it. So one of the tracks is not needed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9f59846cab1d17a0c5e406f5b18d7935750d083","amp;dn":"Fisher+Price+-+Spellbinder+Childrens+Tapes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9f59846cab1d17a0c5e406f5b18d7935750d083","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,245,152,70,202,177,209,122,12,94,64,111,91,24,215,147,87,80,208,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

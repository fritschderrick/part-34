In 1990, Dunn helped his own mother (who was adopted as a baby) locate her biological family, and that single event inspired him and his then-business partner to build an organization that did one thing: help people reunite with long-lost friends and family members. ``APB With Troy Dunn'' documents the work he does, which was previously filmed for WE TV's five-season run of ``The Locator.'' A more modern twist in ``APB,'' however, allows TNT viewers to use a social media app to contribute to Dunn's mission of bringing families and loved ones back together.\n\n\nFirst Aired: \tFebruary 7, 2014\nAir Day: \tFriday\nAir Time: \t9:00 PM\nRuntime: \t43 minutes\nNetwork: \tTNT\nGenre: \t        Reality\n\n\n\nEpisode Synopsis: Troy helps a woman locate her sister.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d705b3310fe4858af377fdd5b6faaa37e1350fc","amp;dn":"APB+With+Troy+Dunn+S01E04+Sisterhood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d705b3310fe4858af377fdd5b6faaa37e1350fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,112,91,51,16,254,72,88,175,55,127,221,91,111,170,163,126,19,80,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

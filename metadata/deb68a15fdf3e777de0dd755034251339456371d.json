These are two fascinating areas she covers from top to bottom, so you can create a beautiful garden brimming with roses.\r\n\r\nPalmstierna begins by explaining the difference between a â€œmodern roseâ€ versus an â€œold-fashionedâ€ variety. She then aids readers in selecting the right type of rose for their garden by providing detailed information on more than fifty popular rose varietiesâ€”pick your favorites by color or the type of environment in which each species thrives. Roses that grow as ground cover, for example, are easy to look after and are attractive on slopes and larger areas; roses that climb are perfect for a trellis or arch; and roses that grow as bushes are sturdy and can flower several times a season. And if youâ€™d prefer to grow your roses in a pot on a balcony or terrace, youâ€™ll also learn how to care for them in winter!\r\n\r\nAfter youâ€™ve learned which plants work best as companions to your roses, Palmstierna launches into the ever-important care of your roses, explaining the simplest ways to plant and prune. Youâ€™ll also master how to buy and select the best plants from shops and garden centers and deal with common rose problems, including improving the soil and dealing with pests.\r\n\r\nStart growing your beautiful, thriving rose garden today!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deb68a15fdf3e777de0dd755034251339456371d","amp;dn":"Practical+Rose+Gardening+%282015%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deb68a15fdf3e777de0dd755034251339456371d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,182,138,21,253,243,231,119,222,13,215,85,3,66,81,51,148,86,55,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

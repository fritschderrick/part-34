The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.\r\n\r\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive.\r\n\r\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nInspired by real-life events \r\nControl your survivors and manage your shelter \r\nCraft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves â€“ anything that helps you survive \r\nMake decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience \r\nRandomized world and characters every time you start a new game \r\nCharcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme\r\nSupported languages:\r\nEnglish, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Russian, Turkish, Japanese, Korean, Portugese-Brazil\r\n\r\nWhat's new in this version : (Updated : Dec 15, 2015)\r\nCritical bugfix: Game freeze / crash after day 42 and 45.\r\nBugfix: Old Town location freezes.\r\nBugfix: Freezes after picking up items.\r\nBugfix: 5 survivors in a shelter issue.\r\nRequired Android O/S : 4.0+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1544e25cba918ea8ba4532de7fa03c8582c6d105","amp;dn":"This+War+of+Mine+v1.3.8+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1544e25cba918ea8ba4532de7fa03c8582c6d105","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,68,226,92,186,145,142,168,186,69,50,222,127,160,60,133,130,198,209,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

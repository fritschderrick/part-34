Besides the details of experimental set ups, also the underlying theoretical basis is presented in detail. In addition, a number of applications based on drops and bubbles is discussed, such as rising bubbles and the very complex process of flotation. Also wetting, characterized by the dynamics of advancing contact angles is discussed critically. Special application like a double capillary arrangement for single drop manipulations, and the so-called fibre drop analyzer are presented as excellent examples for the use of drops in interfacial science.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 665 pages\n# Publisher: BRILL (June 9, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 9004174958\n# ISBN-13: 978-9004174955","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fad3f9eee32b42fa65bbb7c95e6edeedb982aa94","amp;dn":"Bubble+and+Drop+Interfaces+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fad3f9eee32b42fa65bbb7c95e6edeedb982aa94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,211,249,238,227,43,66,250,101,187,183,201,94,110,222,237,185,130,170,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

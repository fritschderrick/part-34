According to legend, he is said to have found the philosopher's stone and attained immortality. Today, this is commonly dismissed as a fairy tale. The philologist Remy Chaveau thinks the same until he gets hold of a previously unknown diary. The book documents the search for Flamelâ€™s mysteries in a very cryptic way and it looks like the diary's author was close to solving them just before he died.

Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Disappearance Of The GirlÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ has been over four years in the making and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certainly benefited from it. Hats off then to her label Decca Records for allowing the interaction between the artist and producer Ross Cullum culminating in such a wonderful collection of songs here.\n\nThe title track Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Disappearance Of The GirlÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ has a laid back almost lullaby beat to it cemented by a delicately laced string arrangement. Topped by PhildelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique vocals that make such lyrics Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦if I could persuade you Ã¢â‚¬Â¦. you know he betrays you Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ this much as he saves youÃ¢â‚¬Å“. In stark contrast Ã¢â‚¬ËœStorm SongÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ shunts off slowly for you at first and then picks up speed and turns into a monster of a song. She manages to show a full vocal range of her voice and far from being a banshee as mentioned. No wonder this was chosen as the lead single. The plucked notes of Ã¢â‚¬ËœMistakeÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ announce its beginning and without warning it steps up several gears with her voice not phased by this sudden shift. Just as your ears adjust to it so once again it returns to itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previously slower pace, a song that certainly grows on you.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc9c0d265b5d83b3d792d72c7a35982bc043e867","amp;dn":"Phildel+-+The+Disappearance+of+the+Girl+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc9c0d265b5d83b3d792d72c7a35982bc043e867","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,156,13,38,91,93,131,179,215,146,215,44,122,53,152,43,192,67,232,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

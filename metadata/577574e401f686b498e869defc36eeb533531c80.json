There are two versions of the main albums, a CD version and a vinyl version, the vinyl versions are marked as such. The vinyls are from a FLAC source, and everything else was 320 CBR MP3. The exception is the XX collection, which was a FLAC rip from a CD.\n\nThe only thing I did was rename folders, remove .cue files, and touch up the faded album cover to the XX album, as I believe it wasn't scanned properly. And of course, I converted everything to V0 MP3 to saved space and preserve quality. Some folders have the .txt files from the original authors, explaining the original files before conversion.\n\nThere's album art included for every album, some are higher resolutions than others, though, I remember a few being very crappy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:577574e401f686b498e869defc36eeb533531c80","amp;dn":"Rage+Against+The+Machine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"577574e401f686b498e869defc36eeb533531c80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,117,116,228,1,246,134,180,152,232,105,222,252,54,238,181,51,83,28,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

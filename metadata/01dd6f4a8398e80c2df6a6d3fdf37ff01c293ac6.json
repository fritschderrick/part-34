The band's hits include covers of Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Blinded By The Light&quot; and &quot;Spirit In The Night&quot;. After forming in 1971 and despite a short hiatus in the late 80s/early 90s, the Earth Band has continued to perform and tour through the present.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Nightingales &amp; Bombers is an album released in 1975 by Manfred Mann's Earth Band.\n\n &quot;The title of this album was inspired by a recording made in Surrey, England during the Second World War, by an ornithologist intending to record Nightingales. The bombers flew over at the same time and were recorded by accident. The recording has been incorporated in 'As Above, So Below'&quot;. - Manfred Mann 1975.\n\n The recording was made on 19 May 1942 by a BBC sound engineer for the BBC. Intending to capture the nightingale's song he also, by accident, recorded the sound of RAF bombers on their way to attack Mannheim, Germany. In that raid 197 planes were dispatched and 12 were lost.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonnel:\n\nManfred Mann: organ, synthesisers\nMick Rogers: guitars, vocals\nChris Slade: drums, percussion\nColin Pattenden: bass\n\nWith:\n\nRuby James: backing vocals\nDoreen Chanter: backing vocals\nMartha Smith: backing vocals\nDavid Millman: viola\nChris Warren-Green: violin\nNigel Warren-Green: cello\nGraham Elliott: cello\nDavid Boswell-Brown: cello","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01dd6f4a8398e80c2df6a6d3fdf37ff01c293ac6","amp;dn":"Manfred+Mann%27s%2FNightingales+%26amp%3B+Bombers+%5B1975%5D%5B2012%5D%5B320KBPS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01dd6f4a8398e80c2df6a6d3fdf37ff01c293ac6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,221,111,74,131,152,232,12,45,246,166,211,253,243,127,240,28,41,58,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

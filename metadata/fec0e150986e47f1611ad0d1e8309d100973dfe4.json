Enjoy Young Liers.\n\nThis story has so many twists and turns, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult to pin down. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best described as Archie comics if David Lynch directed a script based on a William S. Burroughs novel. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s punk rock on acid. I imagine Warren Ellis to be a big fan.\n\nIn the first issue Lapham introduces us to a cast of flawed characters down and out in NYC: Danny Noonan, our unreliable narrator, Sadie Dawkins the daughter of a crazed business tycoon who happens to have a bullet lodged in her brain, heroine addict and cross-dresser Don Diego, anorexic model Jackie, groupie Cee Cee, and silver spoon Truman Runco. They have few redeemable qualities and many flaws: low self-esteem, unrealized dreams, lack of self-control, the list goes on.\n\nFor the most part, the story is told through Danny, who may or may not be the lead character. This honour could very possibly go to Sadie (or another as-yet-to-be-identified character). WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll know when this all wraps up.\n\nWhen the series opens, Danny is a wanna-be. He wants to be a rock star. Wants to move out of his small town. Wants to live a big life. Wants to fuck Sadie. However, the answer to who is Danny is not easy to answer. During the course of the series, he is possibly committed to a mental institute. Is possibly a spider prince from the planet Mars sent to Earth to save his queen Sadie (honest). Is possibly bone fide rock star Danny Duoshade. Is possibly living at the centre of a huge reality conspiracy.\n\nThe story is at turns Twin Peaks, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and The Truman Show. The one thing the reader knows for sure is that nothing in Young Liars is as it seems (as the title suggests).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abiMWxTf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abiMWxTf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acwKnXN2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acwKnXN2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acjS3yI2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acjS3yI2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adb261ou.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adb261ou.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abmXtBJp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abmXtBJp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/accm24mS.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/accm24mS.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abd3nnBK.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abd3nnBK.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/aciDoIvK.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/aciDoIvK.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fec0e150986e47f1611ad0d1e8309d100973dfe4","amp;dn":"Young+Liars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fec0e150986e47f1611ad0d1e8309d100973dfe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,192,225,80,152,110,71,241,97,26,208,209,232,48,157,16,9,115,223,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It scans every inch of your system, removes gigabytes of junk in just two clicks, and monitors the health of your Mac.\n\nAll your Mac cleaning in one place.\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so much to clean on your Mac, and CleanMyMac 3 takes care of all of it.\nLearn more about all the things it does below.\n\nYour Mac deserves its own cleaning genius.\nCleanMyMac 3 shows you what to clean, you just have to choose when. It scans everything on your Mac, including your MacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s system, iTunes, Mail, iPhoto, Trash bins, and even old folders that have been secretly avoiding you. Plus, it knows exactly what can be safely cleaned from your Mac and what canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. Almost like itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a brain or something. \n\nOne-button cleaning.\nMacs are easy to use. Mac cleaners should be too. CleanMyMac 3Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Smart Cleanup relies on just one button to scan every inch of your Mac and then remove the junk it finds. And, it only selects files that are 100% safe-to-delete, so you never have to worry about removing the wrong ones. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just an automatic cleaning utility Ã¢â‚¬â€ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incredibly smart.\n\nSmart cleaners are safe cleaners.\nOur number one priority is keeping your Mac safe. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been building our safe cleanup algorithm for over 6 years now. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s called the Safety Database and is a list of rules, items, and exceptions that CleanMyMac 3 refers to every time it scans your Mac. With CleanMyMac 3, you can be absolutely sure that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re only cleaning up the right files.\n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve designed a system\nfor cleaning yours up.\nWhenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the last time you used one of your apps in Swahili? What about Tetum? ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what we thought. And, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more than just language files that are wasting space on your system. CleanMyMac 3 lets you get rid of all the added extras on your Mac, without the worry of removing a critical file. \n\nTrim gigabytes off your photo library Ã¢â‚¬â€ without losing a single picture.\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not your photos that are wasting space, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the hidden copies in your iPhoto library. You see, anytime you edit or rotate a photo, iPhoto creates a duplicate of the original and hide it for safe keeping. This means gigabytes of useless copies. CleanMyMac 3 cleans out all of them without harming any of your photos. \n\nWhat's New 3.0.2:\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new:\nPreferences: Added possibility to choose submodules of System Cleanup and iTunes Cleanup to be included to Smart CleanupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s full scan. \n\nBugs fixed:\n\nLarge &amp; Old Files: Photos libraries are not analyzed anymore, and are not included to its scan results. \nMaintenance: Improved UI notifications. \nExtensions: Fixed disabling extension functionality. \nFixed all common crashes and exceptions \n\nRequirements\nIntel, 64-bit processor OS X 10.8 or later","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab45adeb9b3ae78f548d35f8574cca1d6e7e2c6","amp;dn":"CleanMyMac+3.0.2+K%27ed+-+Odin79","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab45adeb9b3ae78f548d35f8574cca1d6e7e2c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,180,90,222,185,179,174,120,245,72,211,95,133,116,204,161,214,231,226,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

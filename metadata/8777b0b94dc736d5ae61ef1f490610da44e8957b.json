All Falls Quiet\n\nHis bio from a music festival in Germany:\n\nBefore life brought River Crombie to Hamburg he lived some time in the mountains east of Melbourne. The stillness and quietude of this landscape developed the soul of his music and lyrics. Although he is an exquisite guitarist his songs have a poetic simplicity to them. His soft voice wakes a longing for the good old days. One thinks of Paul Simon, Nick Drake or John Martyn. At Melodica everyone will discover that River Crombie is the real folk!\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8777b0b94dc736d5ae61ef1f490610da44e8957b","amp;dn":"River+Crombie...Time+Beyond+Me%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8777b0b94dc736d5ae61ef1f490610da44e8957b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,119,176,185,77,199,54,213,174,97,239,31,73,6,16,218,68,232,149,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

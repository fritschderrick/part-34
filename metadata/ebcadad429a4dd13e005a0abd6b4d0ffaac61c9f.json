That goes especially for you leeching f**kwits with zero uploads who always write &quot;seeeeed pleeeeaaaase!!!&quot; if a download takes more than 20mins to complete.\n\nYou're getting this for free, so don't f**king complain about it. If my upload isn't good enough for all of your Royal Highnesses out there, then go and buy the bloody album.\n\n----------------\n\nKeeping the content fresh since 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebcadad429a4dd13e005a0abd6b4d0ffaac61c9f","amp;dn":"Arkham+Witch+-+Legions+Of+The+Deep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebcadad429a4dd13e005a0abd6b4d0ffaac61c9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,202,218,212,41,164,221,19,224,5,160,171,214,180,208,255,170,198,28,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

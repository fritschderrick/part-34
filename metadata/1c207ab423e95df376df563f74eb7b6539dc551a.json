If you know the Black Keys then it&amp;#039;s more of what you love, medium-hard blues rock, with a little bit extra. A perfect example of how a band can evolve into something slightly different without changing all the best parts that they&amp;#039;re fans have come to love. It&amp;#039;s produced by Danger Mouse, one of my favorite producers, and I love what he&amp;#039;s done with this album.\n\nHere&amp;#039;s the track list:\n\nCD: The Black Keys - Attack &amp; Release\nYEAR: 2008\n\n01. All You Ever Wanted [0:02:56.19]\n02. I Got Mine [0:03:59.11]\n03. Strange Times [0:03:10.24]\n04. Psychotic Girl [0:04:10.53]\n05. Lies [0:03:59.01]\n06. Remember When (Side A) [0:03:21.39]\n07. Remember When (Side B) [0:02:11.00]\n08. Same Old Thing [0:03:09.22]\n09. So He Won&amp;#039;t Break [0:04:14.22]\n10. Oceans And Streams [0:03:26.24]\n11. Things Ain&amp;#039;t Like They Used To Be [0:04:36.31]\n\nAlso, check out their older stuff, too. This is they&amp;#039;re sixth album and I think these guys are what the White Stripes used to be, back before Icky Thump (not a fan of that album). Maybe I&amp;#039;ll upload De Stijl later for those of you that don&amp;#039;t know what I&amp;#039;m talking about. And if anyone has anymore Black Keys CDs that they could upload in FLAC I&amp;#039;d be really grateful. All the rest of my Keys albums are in mp3. I&amp;#039;m open to requests, contributions, and suggestions in terms of music from anyone that likes my taste. I&amp;#039;ll have a few more albums going up later as each torrent gets a couple of seeds I&amp;#039;ll start a new one.\n\nOn the coming up list are:\nBlack Rebel Motorcycle Club - Howl\nGorillaz - Demon Days\nBob Dylan Live 1966 - The Royal Albert Hall Concert\nWhite Stripes - De Stijl\n\nAnd Black Mountain - In the Future went up earlier today if you missed it.\nI&amp;#039;ll have a lot more when I get back to my full CD collection at home in a couple weeks as well. And who knows what I&amp;#039;ll pick up between now and then...\n\nOne more thing - I&amp;#039;ve been looking for a FLAC torrent of Comus&amp;#039;s First Utterance if anyone has it. There used to be one but it looks like it&amp;#039;s been long dead.\n\nEnjoy, and purchase a Black Keys CD if you like it. Or some merch. Or see a show. Let&amp;#039;s support the artists we love. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c207ab423e95df376df563f74eb7b6539dc551a","amp;dn":"The+Black+Keys+-+Attack+%26+Release+-+slavetothesounds+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c207ab423e95df376df563f74eb7b6539dc551a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,32,122,180,35,233,93,243,118,223,86,63,116,235,123,101,57,220,85,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

An artistic genius, raised on a tree farm in Indiana by a callous father, Rich wrestled all of his life with the brokenness and crippling insecurity born of his childhood. A lover of Jesus and a rebel in the church, Rich refused to let his struggles with his own darkness tear him away from a God he was determined to love. As he struggled with success in Nashville and depression in Wichita, Rich desired most of all to live a life of honest and reckless faith amidst a culture of religion and conformity.              \n\nACTORS: \nDavid Schultz, Michael Koch, Wolfgang Bodison, James Kyson, Mitch McVicker, Elizabeth Roberts, \n\nRELEASED: \n 9 January 2014 \n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2412568/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2412568/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n Size: 9384064214 bytes (8.74 GiB), duration: 02:20:36, avg.bitrate: 8899 kb/s\nAudio: ac3, 48000 Hz, 5:1 (eng)\nVideo: h264, yuv420p, 1920x1080, 23.98 fps(r) (eng)\nSubtitles: eng spa \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=94753341367232681232.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=94753341367232681232.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=75153203179529523396.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=75153203179529523396.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=49373068188673046891.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgclik.com/viewer.php?file=49373068188673046891.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD AND ENJOY. \n\n KEEP IT FOR LONG SEEDING TO HELP OTHERS \n\n \n Thanks to : SADPANDA\n Movie Share ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95a166c49a8ad77a1b287f79004256e045cfb666","amp;dn":"Ragamuffin+2014+2014+1080p+BluRay+x264-SADPANDA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95a166c49a8ad77a1b287f79004256e045cfb666","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,161,102,196,154,138,215,122,27,40,127,121,0,66,86,224,69,207,182,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

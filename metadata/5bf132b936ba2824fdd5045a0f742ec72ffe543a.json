He was born in 1926 as son of a German mother and a Liberian law student, the only independent black African state at that time apart from Ethiopia. His grandfather was the Liberian consul-general to Hamburg. When his father and grandfather went back to Liberia in 1929, his mother decided to stay in Germany. She made her living working as a nurse, and she and the little boy had to move from the elegant villa to a modest cold-water apartment in the workersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ quarter Barmbek. He was shunned but was never a target of Nazi persecution like Jews and Roma were. He was rebuffed when he applied for membership in the Hitler Jugend (Hitler Youth), while every young male Aryan German was obliged to be a member. Moreover, due to his skin colour, he was never drafted.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bf132b936ba2824fdd5045a0f742ec72ffe543a","amp;dn":"Destined+to+Witness+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bf132b936ba2824fdd5045a0f742ec72ffe543a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,241,50,185,54,186,40,36,253,213,4,90,15,116,46,199,47,254,84,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

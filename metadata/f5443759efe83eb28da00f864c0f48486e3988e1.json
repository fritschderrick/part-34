It is a gripping and surprisingly well-produced oater (considering its modest budget). It really succeeds in evoking the terror of man alone against the wilderness. The villains - of which there are a number - appear two-dimensional and even sympathetic; e.g., Captain Addis and his men, reduced by massacre and desertion, perform almost heroically in their desperation (watch for Harry Dean Stanton's understated role as a cavalry sergeant). The Apaches are seen as brutal, but no more so than their white enemies or the surrounding deserts and moutains, which are haughtingly evoked in this first-rate western. Highly recommended.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5443759efe83eb28da00f864c0f48486e3988e1","amp;dn":"Day+of+the+Evil+Gun+%5B1968%5D+-+Western","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5443759efe83eb28da00f864c0f48486e3988e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,68,55,89,239,232,62,178,141,160,15,134,76,15,72,72,110,57,136,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Now, America finds itself cash poor, and to a great extent power follows money. In The End of Influence, renowned economic analysts Stephen S. Cohen and J. Bradford DeLong explore the grave consequences this loss will have for AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s place in the world.\nAmerica, Cohen and DeLong argue, will no longer be the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hyperpower. It will no longer wield soft cultural power or dictate a monolithic foreign policy. More damaging, though, is the blow to the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to innovate economically, financially, and politically. Cohen and DeLong also explore AmericanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s complicated relationship with China, the misunderstood role of sovereign wealth funds, and the return of state-led capitalism.\nAn essential read for anyone interested in how global economics and finance interact with national policy, The End of Influence explains the far-reaching and potentially long-lasting but little-noted consequences of our great fiscal crisis.\nGenre: Non-Fiction&gt; World Politics &amp; Affairs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a2537ce9735a553a65216ae8b0824a55ee63e30","amp;dn":"End+of+Influence_+What+Happens+When+Other+Countries+Have+the+Mon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a2537ce9735a553a65216ae8b0824a55ee63e30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,37,55,206,151,53,165,83,166,82,22,174,139,8,36,165,94,230,62,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

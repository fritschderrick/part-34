He also established himself as one of the finest professional wrestlers in the world today with historic bouts against the likes of Samoa Joe, Homicide, Bryan Danielson, &amp; Christopher Daniels, and will forever be considered a legend in ROH.\n \nBut for three months in the summer of 2005, Punk shocked Ring of Honor fans &amp; officials alike and it all began one night in June when ROH gathered to bid farewell to one of their own as Punk challenged for the ROH World Title one final time.

On her steps she finds a letter. It is a hand-written request from one of Britainâ€™s most prolific and well-loved novelists. Vida Winter, gravely ill, wants to recount her life story before it is too late, and she wants Margaret to be the one to capture her history. The request takes Margaret by surprise â€” she doesnâ€™t know the author, nor has she read any of Miss Winterâ€™s dozens of novels.\r\n\r\nLate one night while pondering whether to accept the task of recording Miss Winterâ€™s personal story, Margaret begins to read her fatherâ€™s rare copy of Miss Winterâ€™s Thirteen Tales of Change and Desperation. She is spellbound by the stories and confused when she realizes the book only contains twelve stories. Where is the thirteenth tale? Intrigued, Margaret agrees to meet Miss Winter and act as her biographer.\r\n\r\nAs Vida Winter unfolds her story, she shares with Margaret the dark family secrets that she has long kept hidden as she remembers her days at Angelfield, the now burnt-out estate that was her childhood home. Margaret carefully records Miss Winterâ€™s account and finds herself more and more deeply immersed in the strange and troubling story.\r\n\r\nBoth women will have to confront their pasts and the weight of family secrets... and the ghosts that haunt them still","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5141bb3fb7dd764a62c92b44cf540fdadc580395","amp;dn":"The+Thirteenth+Tale+audiobook+by+Diane+Setterfield+EarReaders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5141bb3fb7dd764a62c92b44cf540fdadc580395","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,65,187,63,183,221,118,74,98,201,43,68,207,84,15,218,220,88,3,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

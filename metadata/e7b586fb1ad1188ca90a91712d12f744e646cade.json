Vampire-hero, enchanter, seducer of mortals. For centuries he has been a courted prince in the dark and flourishing universe of the living dead. Lestat is alone. And suddenly all his vampire rationale--everything he has come to believe and feel safe with--is called into question. In his overwhelming need to destroy his doubts and his loneliness, Lestat embarks on the most dangerous enterprise he has undertaken in all the danger-haunted years of his long existence.\n\nThe Tale of the Body Thief is told with the unique--and mesmerizing--passion, power, color, and invention that distinguish the novels of Anne Rice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7b586fb1ad1188ca90a91712d12f744e646cade","amp;dn":"tale+of+the+body+thief%2C+The+-+Anne+Rice-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7b586fb1ad1188ca90a91712d12f744e646cade","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,181,134,251,26,209,24,140,169,10,145,113,45,18,247,68,230,70,202,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

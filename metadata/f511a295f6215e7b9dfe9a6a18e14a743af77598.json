Starting on the Rue Saint-Jacques then trekking 750 miles south to Roncesvalles, Spain, their eccentric route takes 72 days on Roman roads and pilgrimage pathsÃ¢â‚¬â€a 1,100-year-old network of trails leading to the sanctuary of Saint James the Greater. It is best known as El Camino de Santiago de CompostelaÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬Å“The WayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for short. The object of any pilgrimage is an inward journey manifested in a long, reflective walk. For Downie, the inward journey met the outer one: a combination of self-discovery and physical regeneration. More than 200,000 pilgrims take the highly commercialized Spanish route annually, but few cross France. Downie had a goal: to go from Paris to the Pyrenees on age-old trails, making the pilgrimage in his own maverick way. 32 pages of color photographs by Alison Harris. 32 pages of color photographs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f511a295f6215e7b9dfe9a6a18e14a743af77598","amp;dn":"Paris+to+the+Pyrenees%3A+A+Skeptic+Pilgrim+Walks+the+Way+of+Saint","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f511a295f6215e7b9dfe9a6a18e14a743af77598","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,17,162,149,246,33,94,123,157,254,154,106,24,225,74,116,58,247,117,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

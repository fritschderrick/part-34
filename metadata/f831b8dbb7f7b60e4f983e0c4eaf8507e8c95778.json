Laws, customs, machines, figures of speech; many have their roots in the Napoleonic era. From the metric system and massive road construction projects; the Louisiana Purchase to the roots of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s European legal systems. What energy, what charisma must this man have had in order to turn the centuries old structures that shaped Europe until the 18th century upside down within a matter of just a few years?\n\nNapoleon was a figure as full of contradiction for the time he lived in as he is for us today. How did he manage to unite the people behind him? What forces did he align himself with, what dynamics did he utilise?\n\nIn four episodes we examine what life was like in Europe from 1799 until 1815, from the end of the French Revolution until NapoleonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s defeat at Leipzig 1813 and Waterloo 1815. We show NapoleonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rise and fall exclusively from the point of view of the citizens of his time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ blacksmiths, soldiers, farmers, dissidents, housewives - first hand accounts of life changing events, based on authentic historical material, diaries, letters and court documents, and often surprising anecdotes from NapoleonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reign. These donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t speak of politics and alliances but about blood and tears, tyranny and hunger, about joy and freedom.\n\nEpisode 1: The Conqueror\nEpisode 2: The Revolutionary\n\nThe Other Episodes available from...\n-------------------------------------\nEpisode 3: The Overlord\nEpisode 4: The Defeat of Napoleon\n\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE.

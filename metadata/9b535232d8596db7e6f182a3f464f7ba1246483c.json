There is no public vote this week, but the couples still have to impress the Strictly judges, whose scores will be carried through to next week. Will it be murder on the dancefloor, or will all those hours in the training room pay off? Whose nerves will get the better of them, and who will be cha cha cha-ing their way to the top of the leader board?\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 27-Sep-2013\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nVideo\n\nCodec: MPEG-4 Video (mp4v)\nResolution: 640x360\nFrame Rate: 25\nDecoded Format: Planar 4:2:0 YUV\n\n\n\nAudio\n\nCodec: MPEG AAC (mp4a)\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44100 Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b535232d8596db7e6f182a3f464f7ba1246483c","amp;dn":"Strictly.Come.Dancing.S11E02.PDTV.x264-TM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b535232d8596db7e6f182a3f464f7ba1246483c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,83,82,50,216,89,109,183,230,241,130,163,244,100,247,186,18,70,72,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

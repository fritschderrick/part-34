This track from the album Sheikh was recorded in two Project studios in Bristol and Portishead. It was mixed in the DRC studio, Portishead.\n\nThe influences are many on Sheikh, but the objective is to entertain and stimulate and that involves our take on many different styles and types of music. Sheikh was designed to be heard in Surround sound but Stereo mixes are available. We have tried to present these songs in the best possible Audio quality, even though this album was created with zero budget and limited resources.\n\nContact us via &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a9ddc1cccdc8dbc2cbc8c7cde9cbddc0c7ddccdbc7ccdd87cac6c4&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; for info on how to get the DVD audio.\nAnother DRC Production.

Karakull  \n\nNames in Marble is based on the personal experiences of Albert Kivikas during the Estonian War of Independence. Through the main characters of the book, the two major political movements of the era, nationalism and communism are portrayed. The book also portrays the uncertainty among Estonians at that period about the future of the country.\n\nThe novel is divided in three parts. The main characters of the novel are two brothers, Henn and Juhan Ahas. In the first part, set at the beginning of the Estonian War of Independence, a group of students from Tartu join the Estonian forces (most students join immediately). In the beginning, Henn Ahas hesitates but after his hometown is attacked he joins the army. In the first part, the political and economic situation of Estonia and Estonians is described through the group of students. The second part contains autobiographical references and describes the situation at the war front, and the experiences of soldiers. The third part of the novel focuses on the final stage of the war and in particular the Treaty of Tartu, which recognised the independence of Estonia. The book ends with the group of students returning to their homes.\n\nIn 1937 Albert Kivikas was awarded by the Estonian Literature Society for Names in Marble with the State Elder Award (Estonian: Riigivanema auhind) of 1937. This led in 1939 to the publication of a theatrical version of the novel. It was divided in three acts, and contained 109 pages. Names in Marble the play was directed by Ants Lauter and its premiere was on February 24, 1939. The role of Henn Ahas was played by Tees Koppel.\n\nIn 2002 a film bearing the same name and based on the novel was released in Estonia. It was directed by Elmo NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ganen, and Priit VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âµigemast starred as the main character Henn Ahas. Names in Marble is the highest budgeted Estonian feature film and the most successful film in Estonia in terms of box office profits.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e2cf1f8643aa0f99d9e56b0826bf31e305a7995","amp;dn":"Nimed+marmortahvlil+%28eng+subs%29+%5B2002%5D+Elmo+N%C3%83%C2%BCganen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e2cf1f8643aa0f99d9e56b0826bf31e305a7995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,44,241,248,100,58,160,249,157,158,86,176,130,107,243,30,48,90,121,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Can I Strip Myself of the Network of Language size. 20.6 mb, 1h:30m:20s\n\n2. How is Freedom to be Understood and Lived size.     17.7 mb, 1h:17m:42s\n\n3. How is One to Have Complete Order.                  15.7 mb, 1h:08m:38s\n\n3. The Beginning of Meditation.                        18.8 mb, 1h:22m:09s\n\n\n\nI really like the fact that these talks come in such a small file size.\n\nWar is no good. This has nothing to do with peace. Its just a fact.\n\nTo see through the eyes of a God is to become a second hand human being.\n\n\n\nThe past is only what is stored in the mind. And there is no such thing as future.\nWe need to understand that the only thing that exsist is the present. And has always been the present.\n\nWe dont need the past to see what is dangerouse in the present.\n\nIt doesnt take religion to understand that sleeping with another mans wife is no good. And very dangerous.\n\nThe creator has set a clear and unshakable reality set of rule. \n\nOne rule is it doesnt take a bible to know that killing another man is no good whatsoever.\n\nThere is nothing in our body parts that we are born to murder another man.\nWe are not born with a nife comming forth from our hands.\n\nThe knowlege of the past destroys man kind.\n\nWe are humans. Not Solders. \n\nThose who understand spread the word.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd7cc01503cde219df217122370c6d8476a2b1ff","amp;dn":"Krishnamurti_Brockwood_1978_Talk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd7cc01503cde219df217122370c6d8476a2b1ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,124,192,21,3,205,226,25,223,33,113,34,55,12,109,132,118,162,177,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

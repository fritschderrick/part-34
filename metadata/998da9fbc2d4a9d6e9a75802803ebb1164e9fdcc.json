It has already opened the eyes of countless people for a new sight, for an extension of their world view. We are daily receiving appreciative and enthusiastic letters by the readers of this book, which marks the beginning of the EVP research in the public. Nobody can evade the fascination of JÃƒÂ¼rgenson's report. Moreover, it is good publicity for association. The preface has been written by Fidelio KÃƒÂ¶berle. \n\n&quot;In the summer of 1959, Friedrich JÃƒÂ¼rgenson captured some strange voices on his tape by accident. At first he thought to have received parts of a radio programme - until he noticed voices which he knew and which originated from persons who had passed away a long time ago. In the meantime Friedrich JÃƒÂ¼rgenson has collected numerous tapes with such voices. They have been examined by scientists, broadcast radio experts and sound technicians - but no one of them was able to find a plausible technical explanation for this phenomenon.&quot; \n\nNotes:\n\nThis is sort of a classic on transcommunication and EVP from the &quot;pioneer&quot; of transcommunication Friedrich JÃƒÂ¼rgenson.\n\nFriedrich JÃƒÂ¼rgenson while wanting to record bird songs in the early 1970 on his tape recorder discovered odd voices which he later on found stemming from the deceased respective from entities from &quot;the afterlife&quot; or &quot;other dimensions&quot;.\n\nIt is my understanding this book was published in Swedish initially and then later translated into German and some other languages. This is the English translation.\n\nI found this book, despite being a &quot;free book&quot; VERY good and far better than eg. similar books, like the one by Sarah Estep which was mediocre at best.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:998da9fbc2d4a9d6e9a75802803ebb1164e9fdcc","amp;dn":"Voice+Transmissions+With+The+Deceased+-+Friedrich+J%26uuml%3Brgenson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"998da9fbc2d4a9d6e9a75802803ebb1164e9fdcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,141,169,251,194,212,169,214,233,167,88,2,128,62,187,17,100,233,253,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

He created a legend in his youth as captain of the famous Golden Team but adoration turned to persecution when he fled his homeland in 1956. He went on to travel the world with his soccer skills and achieved almost all that can be achieved on a football pitch. He was adored by Real Madrid supporters and played for the Spanish national squad after making Spain his second home. His career as a player lasted an amazing 20 years and after leading the sport on the field, he moved to the bench from where he coached players all the way to the European Cup Finals. He is still greatly admired in Hungary, Spain, Greece, Australia and across the globe. Puskas spent his life bringing people together from all walks of life as he took on new cultures and learned new languages but always remained a true Hungarian at heart...\n\nReview:\n\nPuskas is football, so simple like that. \n\nI saw the movie in the cinema, the last week. I went with my grandpa, who lived sometime in Spain. He was a Real Madrid's fan and in the end, he cried. I was really surprising, I never seen him cry before. But, well, he felt a lot of things. I guess.\n\nI didn't cry, but I felt moved. Because Puskas wasn't only a great football player, was to, a incredible man. Who had an unbelievable life, full of adventure. \n\nAnyway, all these thing can see it in the film. Very well made, with a lot of statements, from many important people, like Di Stefano, Pele, Platini o Beckembauer. The film show all his life, from his beginning in Hungary, until his death in Australia.\n\nThe film has to, beautiful images, old images, and old videos. From 1954 World Cup, and an old Olimpic Games. \n\nI knew Puskas, but I didn't know how incredible was his life. And all the thing that happened. \n\nVery well made, and very good.\n\nMy only criticizes is, they should put or say who was talking. Because, in some cases, like the Hungarians Players, I didn't know who they were, and I would like know. That's all.\n\nNice.\n\nA somewhat conventional but nevertheless quite moving documentary about the great Hungarian footballer Ferenc Puskas, one of the sport's greatest players. His life was quite eventful: born in 1927, he played professionally for 23 (!) years, from 1943 to 1966. In the 1950s he was part of one of the sport's greatest team ever: the Magnificent Magyars, who won the gold medal in the 1952 Olympics, defeated England for the first time in his home turf in 1953 and almost won the World Cup in 1954. After the Hungarian Revolution, he fled Hungary. Because he played in the famous Honved, the Hungarian Army's football team, he had been given the rank of major, so his defection was considered a military desertion. After two years without being able to play in a professional club, he was able to join another great team, Real Madrid, where he excelled as a player for eight more years (despite being already in his thirties), won several cups and become one of his club's leading goal scorers. After retiring as a player, he was a coach (with uneven results) in such disparate countries as Greece, Chile, Paraguay and Australia. He missed his beloved Hungary much; he was able to visit again in 1981 (after 25 years) and returned for good to live there after the fall of Communism. A strength of this film is the good deal of stock footage included from his early years as a player. There is good footage from his post player years as well, where the most notable thing to see is the enormous obesity he reached. As a young man, he seems to have strike many people as arrogant; in middle and old age he become known for his warmth and wide generosity. He died in 2006 after several years of being ravaged by Alzheimer's disease. In the end, is hard not being moved by the life of this man.\n\nPLEASE NOTE, THAT THIS RIP IS THE PROPER, DOUBLE AUDIO VERSION, WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES WHERE NEEDED, AND WITH THE INTERVIEWS OF DVD2!

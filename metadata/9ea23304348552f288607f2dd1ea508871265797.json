Those who had been following Morgan's career knew that he was a magnificent ballad player, and ballads are a very high priority on this CD. Most of the standards that he embraces had been recorded time and time again over the years, including &quot;Skylark,&quot; &quot;I Can't Get Started,&quot; &quot;My One and Only Love,&quot; and &quot;Don't Blame Me.&quot; But Morgan's playing is so personal and so darn soulful that one doesn't mind hearing yet another version of &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love&quot; or &quot;All The Things You Are.&quot; It's best for musicians to stay away from such warhorses unless they have something really personal to bring to them, and thankfully, Morgan does. Though it doesn't offer a lot of surprises, Love, Lost and Found is a rewarding disc that admirers of Morgan's more romantic playing will appreciate.\n_____________________\n\nNot my rip but I've cleaned it up a bit (ID Tags, Art, etc.) FLAC files are untouched.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ea23304348552f288607f2dd1ea508871265797","amp;dn":"Frank+Morgan+-+Love%2C+Lost+%26amp%3B+Found+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ea23304348552f288607f2dd1ea508871265797","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,162,51,4,52,133,82,242,136,96,127,45,209,234,80,136,113,38,87,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

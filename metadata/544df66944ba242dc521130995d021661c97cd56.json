In fact, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leader, Velvet Black, pretty much fired him after his first major assignment. That doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave many options for a guy whose memories all belong to someone else, and whose entire life has been designed to make him the ultimate assassin.\n\nTo all those who left me props on my original torrent of Vol. 1...Many Thank\n\nEnjoy and Seed.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:544df66944ba242dc521130995d021661c97cd56","amp;dn":"Samurai+%281987%29+Vol.+2+complete+Barry+Blair+%26amp%3B+Pat+McEown","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"544df66944ba242dc521130995d021661c97cd56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,77,246,105,68,186,36,45,197,33,19,9,149,208,33,102,28,151,205,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

When you are relaxed, and your mind enters a trance state, you shift your thoughts to your inner state of mind. The subconscious mind is responsible for habits, fears, unresolved conflicts and motivation for our behaviors. To break old habits and create new ones requires a change in the internal motivation, This starts in the belief system and those beliefs affect the values and motivate us to act in negative or positive ways.\n\nWillpower is a conscious activity. The more you try to stop the habitual behavior, the more the inner mind will fight to maintain its actions that are based on the deep rooted beliefs.\n\nPornography Addiction is powerful habit. Hypnosis is the one thing that can break through the habitual and addictive behavior and change it at a core level. I know that hypnotherapy can release the habitual state, change the triggers, restore a healthy sexual attitude and make you respect your relationships, family and self.\n\nAs you listen, you will relax. As you relax, your mind will be directed to release and resolve some of the deeper issues connected with the addictive traits. You will experience yourself in the future when you are no longer interested in porn and create a belief that you have total control over what you choose to do with your time You will feel the success in your work, your relationships, and find out what your new beliefs are about yourself. This is a very comprehensive  program with 14 hypnotherapy sessions.\n\nEach session addresses an aspect of releasing, resolving, healing, disconnecting, and creating the belief in your subconscious mind that you are able to enjoy your family, friends, and relationships and have pride in yourself for creating a life you love.\n\n\n\nHypnotherapy sessions on CD that will create powerful and permanent change.\n\nIntroduction and Journey of Wisdom\nTake a journey into a sacred place in your mind. Meet your wise sage who will give you direction about what is most important at this time, to allow you to be free from porn. Use this session several times in the first two weeks to gain insight and get answers to questions. Your sage is a way to get in touch with your inner needs, wisdom and issues that may be hidden from your conscious mind. Anytime you feel unsettled or confused, you can use this Journey to get answer and direction.\n\nCore Values\nMeet two versions of yourself- the man you were when you felt addicted to porn and the man you are with the character and values and respect when you are free from porn. Look at your addicted self from the outside to gain perspective into the behaviors and values, and then look at your healthy self to create perspective about what is truly important. You will be able to objectively look at the values and beliefs that create addiction or freedom.\n\nFuture Timeline\nExperience two timelines of your future. Your subconscious mind will project the feelings, thoughts, and values in your two futures. One timeline is based on your current behavior and the other is based on your success, freedom from porn, and living a life you love and are proud of. This is a powerful session that will guide your subconscious mind to a great future.\n\nFreedom\nCreate a positive response to help you free yourself from the habitual behavior. You will have an anchor that creates freedom, and allows you to easily walk away from your computer, ignore porn when it is presented, and instantly strengthen your values. You will create a trigger that will become automatic. Anytime you are tempted, you higher values will kick in, you will take a breath and feel an overwhelming sense of freedom.\n\nBelief change\nA very unique process that takes your old programming and the automatic responses you used to have, and replaces it with a new automatic response based on your new values. This is from an NLP process called a SWISH and this process alone can create the success you desire.\n\nDirect suggestion- single voice\nYou can listen as you fall asleep at night and let the suggestions play. The direct suggestion session will ask your mind to seek out real relationships, real intimacy and share the energy of the powerful connection during real sex.\n\nDirect suggestion- double voice\nSame as the direct suggestion, with an added voice layer. The added layer makes this session much deeper and causes some confusion to get the suggestions directly into the subconscious mind. A very effect session to use as you are sleeping.\n\nAddiction Freedom\nA process to disconnect you from any behavior that you feel you are addicted to. In this case you will apply it to the habitual use of porn.\n\nRelease Negative Anchors\nThere are many triggers that make your brain start the process of needing to use porn to find the next thrill. Many things in your surroundings have become powerful triggers that subconsciously take you down that road. In this session you will disconnect from the emotions that are anchored to objects, such as a computer, that make your mind and body compelled to continue.\n\nRelease the Past\nIf you have guilt, anger, old associations and emotions that are making you turn to porn, this session will help you release it. You will also find healing and release for many other emotional conflicts so that you can have a more stable emotional state, feel a sense of balance and learn the positive lesson from past mistakes.\n\nIntro to How to Talk to Yourself\nWhat to say to yourself\nThe way you talk to yourself determines the results you get in life. If you continue to reinforce the bad behaviors by repeating the same old phrases, you will get the same results. This session will actually hypnotize you to speak to yourself with power, creating the outcomes that you DO want, rather than reinforcing the ones you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want.\n\nResolution Activator\nWrite down your outcomes for each month and experience them in this hypnosis session to implant the belief that you are in control and that things are changing. You can use this to help with several aspects of your life. When you do your outcomes for each month be sure to state them as positive, saying that you are free to create success in your life, and your have released yourself from the thoughts of porn. Be careful not to state it as a negative, such as Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I wont look at porn.\n\nSexual Healing\nIf you have some deep issues that create confusion about your sex life, or had conflicts in the past about sex and would like to bring it back into balance, this is a very healthy way to heal it, gently, and restore a healthy sexual outlook.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:728a24f049427f20f51be2129784589848c01dc7","amp;dn":"Wendi+Friesen+-+Breakfree+End+Porn+Addiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"728a24f049427f20f51be2129784589848c01dc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,138,36,240,73,66,127,32,245,27,226,18,151,132,88,152,72,192,29,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

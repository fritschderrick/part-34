They recorded numerous singles and albums and achieved vast regional popularity, but only scored one modest national hit, &quot;Baja.&quot; With little material of their own, they judiciously tapped heavyweights like Lee Hazelwood (who wrote &quot;Baja&quot;), Roger Christian, and Gary Usher, as well as covering tunes by Dick Dale and Henry Mancini. The group shone brightest on their instrumentals, which used mounds of Fender reverb and two rhythm guitars; when they sang, the results were much less successful.\n\nTaken From: &lt;a href=&quot; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:h9fqxqr5ldae&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:h9fqxqr5ldae&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nCollectables' Surfin' with the Astronauts / Everything Is A-OK! combines the Astronauts' first two records. The first, Surfin' With, contains the group's only hit, &quot;Baja,&quot; plus a selection of surf staples like &quot;Misirlou,&quot; &quot;Susie-Q,&quot; &quot;Pipeline,&quot; &quot;Let's Go Trippin',&quot; &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Surfin' USA.&quot; In contrast, Everything Is A-OK! is a little schizophrenic, containing rock &amp; roll (&quot;Money,&quot; &quot;It's So Easy&quot;), blues (&quot;Stormy Monday,&quot; &quot;Big Boss Man&quot;), pop (&quot;Dream Lover&quot;), R&amp;B (&quot;What'd I Say&quot;) and collegiate folk-pop (&quot;If I Had a Hammer,&quot; &quot;Shortnin' Bread&quot;). Needless to say, it doesn't hold together as well as its predecessor, but there are a number of good moments. Furthermore, these two albums, when combined on one disc, capture much of the Astronauts' best music.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:j9fwxqyjldae&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:j9fwxqyjldae&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEntries for the individual albums exist, but they lack reviews:\n\nSurfin' With The Astronauts: &lt;a href=&quot; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:kpfrxq85ld0e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:kpfrxq85ld0e&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEverything Is A-OK!: &lt;a href=&quot; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:0pfrxq85ld0e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:0pfrxq85ld0e&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis CD is for sale at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000008BM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000008BM&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.

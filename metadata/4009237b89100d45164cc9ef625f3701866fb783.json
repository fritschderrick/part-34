Feinstein's aggressive gun control bill may have intentionally been doomed to fail. \n\nAlex also analyzes the prosecution of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, a Philadelphia abortionist charged with snapping the necks of newborn babies with scissors, whose defense says he's being unjustly prosecuted because he's black. \n\nOn today's show, Alex is joined by top researcher Rosa Koire, a veritable expert on the creeping takeover of cities and states under the paralyzing guise of the buzzword &quot;sustainability,&quot; and author of Behind the Green Mask: U.N Agenda 21. \n\nWe'll also hit on Obama's trip to Israel, S. Korea's cyber-attack and other key news items.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.

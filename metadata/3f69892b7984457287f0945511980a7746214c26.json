However, when the base where the Stargate is  kept comes under attack, Rush insists on using the Stargate to evacuate, disregarding the  orders of commanding officer Colonel Everett Young (Louis Ferreira). Lt. Matthew Scott (Brian  J. Smith) is the first officer through the wormhole, leading the military and civilian survivors through before the base is destroyed. What awaits them on the other side is an unmanned automated starship named the Destiny, launched by the Ancients thousands of years ago at the height of their civilization as a portal to other galaxies.\n\nStargate.Universe.S01E01-E03.Extended.Version.DVDRip.XviD-ARCHiViST\n\nXviD | MP3 VBR | 700MB x 2\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f69892b7984457287f0945511980a7746214c26","amp;dn":"Stargate.Universe.S01E01-E03.Extended.Version.DVDRip.XviD-ARCHiV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f69892b7984457287f0945511980a7746214c26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,105,137,43,121,132,69,114,135,240,148,85,17,152,10,119,70,33,76,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

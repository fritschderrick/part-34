To meet these demands, new processing technologies are under investigation and development. Advances in Fruit Processing Technologies incorporates fundamentals in food processing as well as the advances made in recent years to improve final product quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith contributions from a panel of international researchers who present a blend of classical and emerging technologies, the book explores:\r\n\r\nOzone, ultrasound, irradiation, pulsed electric field, vacuum frying, and high-pressure processing\r\n\r\nUltraviolet and membrane processing\r\n\r\nEnzymatic maceration, freeze concentration, and refrigeration\r\n\r\nThe effect of processing on sensory characteristics and nutritional value\r\n\r\nNew trends in modified atmosphere packaging\r\n\r\nThe use of fruit juices as a vehicle for probiotic microorganisms\r\n\r\nPrebiotic oligosaccharides as an alternative for dairy products\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncorporating a series of case studies on the application of various technologies, the book reviews their advantages, limitations, successes, and failures. The contributors also examine the implications of food processing technologies on waste production, energy use, and resource requirements. This comprehensive survey of methods for optimizing fruit quality is an ideal resource for those in the fruit and vegetable industry looking for innovations that can improve efficiency, reduce waste, and cut costs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d977f749b8701195a4e7cbbde049c6fd2a5936e","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Fruit+Processing+Technologies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d977f749b8701195a4e7cbbde049c6fd2a5936e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,151,127,116,155,135,1,25,90,78,124,187,222,4,156,111,210,165,147,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

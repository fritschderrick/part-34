Well, almost. \n\nAccording to someone's Excel listing of all the shows, the three restaurants featured were\n  Mahony's PO Boy Shop - New Orleans, LA\n  Q-Fanatic BBQ and Grill - Champlin, MN\n  Hills' Restaurant and Lounge - Spokane, WA\n\nOne day, I got to thinking that all the parts might be available somewhere. I found two individual segments on YouTube, but the Hill's Restaurant segment was not there. Looking around, I found it right on their website.\n\nThey were all different quality/size, so I did some editing and reconstruction and created this. Because of the show's consistency in it's various lead-ins, I even think I got them in the right order.\n\nIt isn't the highest quality. The best I could do with the worst quality segment was 480x360, but it works pretty well for anyone who wants to watch it.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24c1fd02f3315b025feb5ecad8ae00aaab65ae45","amp;dn":"Diners%2C+Drive-ins+and+Dives-S11E02-Po+Boys%2C+Pasta+and+Pork","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24c1fd02f3315b025feb5ecad8ae00aaab65ae45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,193,253,2,243,49,91,2,95,235,94,202,216,174,0,170,171,101,174,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

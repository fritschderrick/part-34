Competitive products often yield plastic or blurred results. Those based on conventional wavelets tend to introduce artifacts like halos, ringing, or color bleeding around high-contrast edges, or false edge artifacts in smooth areas.\n\nReliable, easy results Noise Ninja excels at getting you &quot;in the ballpark&quot; with default settings, and it responds gracefully and predictably to adjustments. This consistency is unmatched by other tools, which often respond erratically to different images and adjustments.\n\nUnmatched productivity and flexibility Noise Ninja is more than just an algorithm with a user interface. It is a complete solution, designed so you can quickly and easily get the results you want. It includes a rich set of tools, including automatic and manual noise analysis, camera-specific profiles, an innovative &quot;Noise Brush&quot;, and batch processing. Whether you want a one-button automated solution or full interactive control, you can easily adapt the tool to fit your particular workflow needs.\n\nPlug-in or standalone Noise Ninja runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux (standalone only). It is available as a standalone application, and as a plug-in for Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, and compatible hosts.\n\nAdd Noise Ninja to your digital toolkit today. It will pay for itself the first time it rescues an image, whether for publication or for your scrapbook.

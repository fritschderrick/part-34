The Leak Bros. is a rap duo comprised of underground rappers Cage Kennylz and Tame One. Every song on Waterworld is about the drug PCP. The practice of doing PCP is often known as &quot;getting wet,&quot; making the title &quot;Waterworld&quot; a direct reference to the drug. The Leak Bros. made their first appearance on Cage&amp;#039;s 2003 album Weatherproof on the song &quot;Leak Bros.,&quot; which was also solely about PCP.\n\nEvery song on &quot;Waterworld&quot; is about PCP. The terms &quot;wet,&quot; &quot;leak,&quot; &quot;sherm,&quot; &quot;dip,&quot; &quot;death,&quot; &quot;angel dust,&quot; &quot;dust,&quot; &quot;purple rain,&quot; &quot;embalming fluid,&quot; and &quot;formaldehyde&quot; are all street names for PCP, and are all frequently mentioned throughout the album. Lines such as &quot;I smoked this dip once, got high for six months, twenty three days, six hospital stays and I missed lunch&quot; graphically portray the dramatic effects of PCP. Cage and Tame One frequently mention &quot;dipping&quot; cigarettes, blunts and other smoking material in PCP. The track Leakie Leak is supposed to be a voice message left by a girl high on PCP, who claims &quot;I&amp;#039;m dusted, and I want to bust a nut kid.&quot; Dusted is a slang term for being high on PCP.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa9ff87467a42a7b9b4cdf60f7fb2c385bbc72a5","amp;dn":"Leak+Bros+-+Waterworld+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa9ff87467a42a7b9b4cdf60f7fb2c385bbc72a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,159,248,116,103,164,42,123,155,76,223,96,247,251,44,56,91,188,114,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

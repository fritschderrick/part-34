For example, the famous 'the ends justifies the means' quote is actually a gross exaggeration of what Machiavelli originally wrote, which was 'in the actions of all men...when there is no impartial arbiter, one must consider the final result'.The biggest counterargument Bondanella and Musa can supply is the simple fact that they include a less famous piece Machiavelli did called &quot;The Discourses&quot;. This piece is often not mentioned or even casually footnoted because it presents the true Machiavelli - a man who was supportive of a Republic government run by the citizens. Any one who believes Machiavelli is a supporter of despots will be surprised to read him speaking in support for fair and public trials and a balance of power between rulers and their people.\n\nContains:\n\nINTRODUCTION: An Essay on Machiavelli \n\nMACHIAVELLI: A Selective Bibliography of Translations, Editions and Criticisms \n \nTHE PRIVATE LETTERS \n \nTHE PRINCE \n\nTHE DISCOURSES (abridged) \n \nA FABLE: BELFAGOR.

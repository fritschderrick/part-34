This is the first Grateful Dead album on Arista Records after releasing other albums on its own Grateful Dead Records.\n\nAccording to Dennis McNally, Jerry Garcia conceived the idea for the song &quot;Terrapin Part One&quot; while driving across the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge.\n\nThe album was released for the first time on CD in 1987 by Arista Records before being re-released in 2000 by BMG International. It was then remastered, expanded, and released as part of the Beyond Description (1973-1989) box set in October 2004 with studio outtakes and live songs. The remastered version was later released separately on CD on March 7, 2006 by Rhino Records.\n\nThe album incorporates a more symphonic sound bordering on progressive rock styles that were expressed earlier by progressive art rock groups like Yes and Genesis. This was considered by fans to be a major departure from the more jazz-blues and traditional folk styles used by the Grateful Dead earlier in their career, although these elements are still present here. The title track uses strings and a choir to evoke a tighter and more complex structure as opposed to their looser improvisational works. Horns are also employed extensively to &quot;funk up&quot; their sound.\n\nReaction to the album was mixed as many fans thought that it was overproduced and not in keeping with the Grateful Dead's more unpolished free-form style, while others believe it to be their greatest musical achievement.\nThe song &quot;Lady with a Fan&quot; was co-written by Robert Hunter and Jerry Garcia. Robert Hunter said of the song, &quot;I wrote &quot;Terrapin Part One&quot; at a single sitting in an unfurnished house with a picture window overlooking San Francisco Bay during a flamboyant lightning storm. I typed the first thing that came into my mind at the top of the page, the title: Terrapin Station.&quot;\n\n&quot;On the same day, driving to the city, Garcia was struck by a singular inspiration. He turned his car around and hurried home to set down some music that popped into his head, demanding immediate attention.&quot;\n\n&quot;When we met the next day, I showed him the words and he said, &quot;I've got the music.&quot; They dovetailed perfectly and Terrapin edged into this dimension.&quot;\n\nThe Grateful Dead played the first two parts of &quot;Terrapin Station&quot;, and the songs &quot;Estimated Prophet&quot; and &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; in concert rotation until the end of their career, usually as part of the second set. &quot;Terrapin&quot; was played live some 302 times starting on February 26, 1977 at the Swing Auditorium in San Bernardino, California.\n\n&quot;Terrapin Station&quot; was never performed live in full. The most complete performance, which includes the section &quot;Terrapin Transit,&quot; was performed on March 18, 1977 at Winterland Arena. &quot;Terrapin Transit&quot; was only played live once, and is incorrectly labeled as &quot;Alhambra&quot; on circulating copies of the show and the Internet Archive.\n\n\nTrack list\n\n\nSide one\n\n&quot;Estimated Prophet&quot; (John Perry Barlow and Bob Weir) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:37\n&quot;Dancin' in the Streets&quot; (Marvin Gaye, Ivy Jo Hunter, and William &quot;Mickey&quot; Stevenson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:16\n&quot;Passenger&quot; (Phil Lesh and Peter Monk) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:48\n&quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (Traditional) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:29\n&quot;Sunrise&quot; (Donna Godchaux) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:03\n\n\nSide two\n\n&quot;Terrapin Station Part 1&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 16:17\n&quot;Lady with a Fan&quot; (Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter)\n&quot;Terrapin Station&quot; (Garcia and Hunter)\n&quot;Terrapin&quot; (Garcia and Hunter)\n&quot;Terrapin Transit&quot; (Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann)\n&quot;At a Siding&quot; (Hart and Hunter)\n&quot;Terrapin Flyer&quot; (Hart and Kreutzmann)\n&quot;Refrain&quot; (Garcia and Hunter)\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nGrateful Dead\nJerry Garcia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, vocals\nDonna Jean Godchaux Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\nKeith Godchaux Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards, vocals\nMickey Hart Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\nBill Kreutzmann Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\nPhil Lesh Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar\nBob Weir Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, vocals\nAdditional performers\nPaul Buckmaster Ã¢â‚¬â€œ orchestral arrangements\nThe English Choral\nThe Martyn Ford Orchestra\nTom Scott Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lyricon, saxophones on &quot;Estimated Prophet&quot;\nTechnical personnel\nRick Collins Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mastering\nGreg Fulginiti Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mastering\nKeith Olsen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ production, engineering\n\n\n\n\nReissue production credits\n\n\nJames Austin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ production\nHugh Brown Ã¢â‚¬â€œ design, art direction\nReggie Collins Ã¢â‚¬â€œ annotation\nDave Devore Ã¢â‚¬â€œ engineering\nJimmy Edwards Ã¢â‚¬â€œ associate production\nSheryl Farber Ã¢â‚¬â€œ editorial supervision\nTom Flye Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mixing\nCornelius &quot;Snookey&quot; Flowers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ photography\nDavid Gans Ã¢â‚¬â€œ liner notes\nJoe Gastwirt Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mastering, production consultancy\nRobert Gatley Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mixing assistance\nRobin Hurley Ã¢â‚¬â€œ associate production\nEileen Law Ã¢â‚¬â€œ research\nDavid Lemieux Ã¢â‚¬â€œ production\nMary Ann Mayer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ art coordination\nRichard McCaffrey Ã¢â‚¬â€œ photography\nHale Milfgrim Ã¢â‚¬â€œ associate production\nRobert Minkin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ photography\nScott Pascucci Ã¢â‚¬â€œ associate production\nEd Perlstein Ã¢â‚¬â€œ photography\nCameron Sears Ã¢â‚¬â€œ executive production\nPeter Simon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ photography\nSteve Vance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ design, art direction\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d00c5f845d32aa5cccf242fffe8d82d24d385ea9","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+Terraation+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d00c5f845d32aa5cccf242fffe8d82d24d385ea9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,12,95,132,93,50,170,92,204,242,66,255,254,141,130,210,77,56,94,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

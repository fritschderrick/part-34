A number of songs from the album gained significant radio and TV exposure, notably &quot;You Might Think&quot;, which had a memorable music video in heavy rotation on MTV in 1984 and 1985. \n\nAnother hit single frequently seen on MTV was &quot;Magic&quot;, in which singer/songwriter Ric Ocasek walked on water, that is, the water in a swimming pool at a backyard barbecue party. This song reached #12 in the U.S. \n\nThe &quot;Drive&quot; video (directed by actor Timothy Hutton) showed Ocasek, who did not sing the song, arguing with a troubled young woman played by model Paulina Porizkova, whom Ocasek would soon marry. The lead vocal on &quot;Drive&quot; was bassist Benjamin Orr. \n\n&quot;Hello Again&quot; had a video directed by the legendary Andy Warhol -- who also appeared onscreen, further raising the video's curiosity factor. The song &quot;Stranger Eyes&quot; was used in the theatrical trailer of the 1986 film Top Gun, but it never made it into the soundtrack.\n\nThe album was produced by acclaimed producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange. His commitment to the Cars album meant that he wasn't able to work on the forthcoming Def Leppard album, Hysteria. (However, due to delays in that album's recording, Lange was eventually able to produce the album.)\n\nOn October 21, 2010, The Cars confirmed that they have reunited and are recording their first album in 23 years. Greg Hawkes will fill in on bass for Benjamin Orr, who died in 2000.

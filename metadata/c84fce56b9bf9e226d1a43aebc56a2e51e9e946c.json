This music was recorded simply (usually on 4 or 8 track machines instead of 16, 32 or 48 track as is customary nowadays) with the result that every instrument and voice has equal prominence. The sound is sharp, clear and live, with none of the rubbery soundwash quality that over-sophisticated recording techniques sometimes induce. \nThere are no gimmicks, no echo chambers, no sampling or scratching. Just a bunch of highly talented people, in your living room playing salsa from the heart and soul. I challenge you to stay seated during even one of these blinding dance tunes!\n\n                                                                                                       (From liner notes)\n\n\n\n01.

I'll try to make a 320kbps one once I download the FLAC again. I forgot to change the quality.*\n\nCut Off Your Hands - Hollow (2012)\n\n  Released: 2012\n  Genre: Rock\n  Style: Indie Rock, Power Pop\n  Codec: MP3\n  Bit Rate: ~128kbps\n  Cover: Front\n\n  01 You Should Do Better (4:16)\n  02 Hollowed Out (3:54)\n  03 Fooling No One (4:06)\n  04 Nausea (3:28)\n  05 By Your Side (3:38)\n  06 All It Takes (3:25)\n  07 Oh Hell (2:57) \n  08 Down and Out (4:35)\n  09 Buried (4:05)\n\nThree years after their debut, You and I, Cut Off Your Hands returned with Hollow, which featured new guitarist/vocalist Jonathan Lee as well as a revamped sound. The spiky post-punk-isms and experimental ballads of their first album were replaced with a shimmering sound that evoked the breezy melancholy of the Smiths as well as the grooves of late-ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¿80s Manchester.   Hollow's finest moments channel the energy the band had on You and I into this smoother approach: opening track and lead single ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£You Should Do BetterÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ bounces along on guitar filigrees and singer Nick Johnston's newfound croon.  A more concise and consistent outing than their debut, Hollow reaffirms that while Cut Off Your Hands may not be innovators, they're still quite good at what they do.\n\nPlease support the artist and purchase the album if you enjoy it.

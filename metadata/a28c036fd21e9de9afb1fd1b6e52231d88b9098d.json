The guitar-based &quot;soft rock&quot; band categorise their music as &quot;pop&quot;. The band&amp;#039;s members are, Dan Gillespie Sells [vocals/guitar], Richard Jones [bass/backing vocals], Kevin Jeremiah [guitar/backing vocals], Ciaran Jeremiah [keyboards/backing vocals] and Paul Stewart [drums]. Their name comes from a big bar in Paris, which they thought a fitting name for a band but not for a bar. Following a limited release of their debut &amp;#039;Fill My Little World&amp;#039; in late 2005, the band entered the UK Top 10 with their first full release &amp;#039;Sewn&amp;#039; in March 2006. The single was one of the year&amp;#039;s biggest radio hits. Their debut album &amp;#039;Twelve Stops And Home&amp;#039; was released in the UK on June 5th 2006 and on February 27th 2007 in the US. The album title refers to the frequent London Underground journey Dan used to take from central London to Bounds Green on the Piccadilly Line. It also refers to the number of tracks on the album.\n\n&amp;#039;Join With Us&amp;#039; is the second full-length studio album from guitar-based &quot;soft rock&quot; band The Feeling. It was released on February 18th 2008, preceded by the first single from the album, &amp;#039;I Thought It Was Over&amp;#039;. &amp;#039;Join With Us&amp;#039; debuted in the UK Album Charts at No.1, the band&amp;#039;s first. Some might say that this was achieved on the basis of a technicality, as the chart does not combine the two editions of &amp;#039;Back To Black&amp;#039; by Amy Winehouse into one chart position, and would have been that weeks&amp;#039; No.1 album otherwise. The album sold 41,676 copies in the UK during it&amp;#039;s first week and at the time of writing [February 27th 2008] is still at No.1 in the charts. Track 12 contains a hidden track &amp;#039;We Can Dance&amp;#039;, which I have extracted for your listening convenience.\n\nTracks:\n01  I Thought It Was Over\n02  Without You\n03  Join With Us\n04  Spare Me\n05  Turn It Up\n06  I Did It For Everyone\n07  Won&amp;#039;t Go Away\n08  Loneliness\n09  Connor\n10  This Time\n11  Don&amp;#039;t Make Me Sad\n12  The Greatest Show On Earth\n\nHidden Track:\n13  We Can Dance\n\nReleased \t18 February 2008\nGenre \tSoft rock\nLabel \tIsland\nFormat: Mp3\nFile Size: 75.6MB\nEncoder: Lame 3.97","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a28c036fd21e9de9afb1fd1b6e52231d88b9098d","amp;dn":"The+Feeling+-+Join+With+Us%5B2008%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a28c036fd21e9de9afb1fd1b6e52231d88b9098d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,140,3,111,210,30,157,233,175,177,253,27,110,82,35,29,136,185,9,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

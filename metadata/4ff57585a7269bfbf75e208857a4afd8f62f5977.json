Through his innovative approach, storyteller Ricardo Delgado has earned such renowned fans as Burne Hogarth, Ray Harryhausen, Mike Mignola, John Landis, Mark Schultz, and Steve Bissette.\n\nAge of Reptiles: Tribal Warfare\nThundering herds of lizards roam Cretaceous America, and the earth trembles with their passage. Enormous yet graceful meat-eaters shred the still-living meat from the bones of placid plant-eating saurians. Tyrannosaurus Rex, the most fearsome carnivore that ever lived, is king. But even T-rex isn't safe from the greedy eyes and the ravenous appetites of a band of bird-quick Deinonychus.\n\nAge of Reptiles: The Hunt\nHis mother slaughtered by a pack of Ceratosaurs, a terrified Allosaur must make his way across the sweltering deserts of Jurassic North America or face the same fate himself.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ff57585a7269bfbf75e208857a4afd8f62f5977","amp;dn":"Age+of+Reptiles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ff57585a7269bfbf75e208857a4afd8f62f5977","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,245,117,133,167,38,155,251,247,94,32,136,87,164,175,216,246,47,89,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The Prodigal God is a revelation of the very heart of the gospel: God's radical love for sinners of every kind.\n\nTaking you and your small group or church beyond the traditional focus on the wayward younger son, Dr. Keller helps you glean insights from each of the characters in Jesus' parable: the irreligious younger son, the moralistic elder son, and the Father who lavishes his love on both.

Rose Zimmer, the aptly nicknamed Red Queen of Sunnyside, Queens, is an unreconstructed Communist and mercurial tyrant who terrorizes her neighborhood and her family with the ferocity of her personality and the absolutism of her beliefs. Her brilliant and willful daughter, Miriam, is equally passionate in her activism, but flees RoseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suffocating influence and embraces the Age of Aquarius counterculture of Greenwich Village.\n\nBoth women cast spells that entrance or enchain the men in their lives: RoseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aristocratic German Jewish husband, Albert; her nephew, the feckless chess hustler Lenny Angrush; Cicero Lookins, the brilliant son of her black cop lover; MiriamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (slightly fraudulent) Irish folk-singing husband, Tommy Gogan; their bewildered son, Sergius. These flawed, idealistic people all struggle to follow their own utopian dreams in an America where radicalism is viewed with bemusement, hostility, or indifference.\n\nAs the decades pass - from the parlor communism of the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢30s, McCarthyism, the civil rights movement, ragged Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s communes, the romanticization of the Sandinistas, up to the Occupy movement of the moment - we come to understand through LethemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extraordinarily vivid storytelling that the personal may be political, but the political, even more so, is personal.\n\nBrilliantly constructed as it weaves across time and among characters, Dissident Gardens is riotous and haunting, satiric and sympathetic - and a joy to read.\n\nÃ‚Â©2013 Jonathan Lethem (P)2013 Random House Audio\nWhat the Critics Say\n\n&quot;A dysfunctional family embodies a dysfunctional epoch, as the novelist continues his ambitious journey through decades, generations, and the boroughs of New York.... The setup of this novel is so frequently funny that it reads like homage to classic Philip Roth.&quot; (Kirkus Reviews)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d5d0d43fefd8f6ff73b6b6e12cb405f934fdc72","amp;dn":"Audible+Rip+-+Jonathan+Lethem+-+Dissident+Gardens+%28Unb%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d5d0d43fefd8f6ff73b6b6e12cb405f934fdc72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,93,13,67,254,253,143,111,247,59,107,110,18,203,64,95,147,79,220,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

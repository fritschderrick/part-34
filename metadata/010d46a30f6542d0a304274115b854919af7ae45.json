Comedian Bobby Kelly sits poolside with Anthony to go over the now infamous &quot;Time Square incident&quot; which leads into convos about past fights, prison verses juvenile hall, and Bobby's theory that most rock stars speak &quot;half-queer&quot;.

No, that's not a fat joke. They finish up the show talking about porn, silent fucking and jerking off, and the evolution of O&amp;A and the comics that have been on the show. Side Note: Be on the lookout for Bobby's one-hour special, &quot;Live at the Village Underground&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:010d46a30f6542d0a304274115b854919af7ae45","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-08-25+%28MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"010d46a30f6542d0a304274115b854919af7ae45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,13,70,163,15,101,66,208,163,4,39,65,21,184,84,145,154,247,174,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

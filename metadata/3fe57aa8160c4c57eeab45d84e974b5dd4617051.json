Founding members include singer-songwriter and guitarist Dave Matthews, bassist Stefan Lessard, violinist Boyd Tinsley, and drummer Carter Beauford. Saxophonist LeRoi Moore, a founding member, was part of the band until his death in August 2008. His spot is now occupied by Grammy Award-winner Jeff Coffin, of BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la Fleck and the Flecktones fame. With band members who each have roots in differing genres, including jazz, classical music, soul music, and Afrobeat, the combination of each member has created a sound which has earned them fans from a variety of quarters.\n\nThe band is known for their annual summer-long, nationwide tours featuring lengthy improvisational renditions of their songs accompanied by elaborate video and lighting. They have sold over 31 million units in the United States alone, putting them in the Top 100 highest selling music acts of all time.\n\nThe band is a multi-Grammy Award winner, and was awarded the NAACP Chairman's Award. According to Julian Bond, &quot;they sell out the largest arenas on Earth, but frequently give their music away.&quot;\n\nARTIST: Dave Matthews Band\nTITLE: Big Whiskey &amp; The GrooGrux King\nYEAR: 2009\nGENRE: Alternative\nQUALITY: Lame 3.98r V4 160kbps MP3\nSEEDERS: Cheers, Bubanee\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01.

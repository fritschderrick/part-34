He doesnt know why his conviction for small-time theft is wiped from the record ÃƒÂ¢??piff!ÃƒÂ¢?? just like that. Or why $11,500 in walking-around money is laid on him. Alvin doesnt know hes the bait in a snaky government scheme to capture a killer. But hes starting to grow suspicious. Jamie Foxx (Any Given Sunday) plays Alvin, reeling in laughs and heroics in a high-tech action comedy directed by Antoine Fuqua (The Replacement Killers) and also starring The Green Miles David Morse and Doug Hutchison, Set It Offs Kimberly Elise and Jamie Kennedy (the Scream trilogy). The style is cutting-edge cool, the humor is crazy as a Foxx.

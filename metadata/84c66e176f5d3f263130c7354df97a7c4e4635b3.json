Zorg\nBÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©atrice Dalle ... Betty\nGÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rard Darmon ... Eddy\nConsuelo De Haviland ... Lisa\nClÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©mentine CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lariÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© ... Annie\nJacques Mathou ... Bob\nVincent Lindon ... Richard le jeune policier\n\nA stunning film which cuts across the entire narrative range from absolute farce to ultimate tragedy. This movie sums up, for me, France; the geography (from the beaches of the Riviera to the streets of Paris)and the people (between Betty's neurotic femininity and Zorg's sullen ennui). As this is european movie nudity and sex between main two characters is present in the movie. Cannot recommend it enough.\n\nZorg is a handyman working at in France, maintaining and looking after the bungalows. He lives a quiet and peaceful life, working diligently and writing in his spare time. One day Betty walks into his life, a young woman who is as beautiful as she is wild and unpredictable. After a dispute with Zorg's boss they leave and Betty manages to get a job at a restaurant. She persuades Zorg to try and get one of his books published but it is rejected which makes Betty fly into a rage. Suddenly Betty's wild manners starts to get out of control. Zorg sees the woman he loves slowly going insane. Can his love prevail even if it comes to the worst?\n\nLanguage: French\nSubtitles: English\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84c66e176f5d3f263130c7354df97a7c4e4635b3","amp;dn":"37.2.Le.Matin.aka.Betty.Blue.1986.UNCUT.320p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84c66e176f5d3f263130c7354df97a7c4e4635b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,198,110,23,111,93,63,38,49,48,199,53,77,249,122,124,78,70,53,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

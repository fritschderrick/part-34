Still, polls show that Americans really want to give Healthcare.gov a chance, and at the same time polls indicate that our patience is running out with Republicans in Congress. Nicole will unpack the data on Obamacare and explore what the future looks like for the GOP.\n\nWhile Tea Party Republicans were the most visible during the GOP's shutdown/debt default stunt, it appears they had some serious help from conservatives in the Catholic Church. Adele Stan, Senior Washington Correspondent for RHRealityCheck, will talk with Nicole about the church's latest attempts to stop contraception coverage in ObamacareÃ¢â‚¬â€and what they're willing to do next.\n\nActivist, son of the Godfather of the religious right, and best-selling author of the new novel 'And God Said Billy' Frank Schaeffer will also talk with Nicole about Republicans like Ted Cruz and why it's time to stop being polite to the extreme religious right.\n\nFinally, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research Dean Baker will discuss the most important topic in America now: Jobs. Dean and Nicole will go over today's jobs numbers, explain the effect Obamacare may have on employment, and look at where America is headed now that the shutdown is over and the 2014 budget battles have begun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eefd098bfdc083d8f57b1e9f304bfa77d01517c7","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+with+Nicole+Sandler+-+October+22+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eefd098bfdc083d8f57b1e9f304bfa77d01517c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,253,9,139,253,192,131,216,245,123,30,159,48,75,250,119,208,21,23,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

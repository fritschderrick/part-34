It presents real-world applications of simulated and synthesized materials, including organic-, inorganic-, bio-, and nanomaterials, and helps readers determine the best method for their simulation. It gets novices up to speed quickly and helps experienced practitioners discover novel approaches and alternatives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f0a32c6bd0d81f40f6b5d42904508b773b18c4f","amp;dn":"Multiscale+Simulation+Methods+for+Nanomaterials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f0a32c6bd0d81f40f6b5d42904508b773b18c4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,10,50,198,189,13,129,244,15,107,93,66,144,69,8,183,115,177,140,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

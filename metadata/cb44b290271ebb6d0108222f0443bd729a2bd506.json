Its music is generally faster and more simplistic than that of King of the Dead, which saw the band adopt a doom metal style influenced heavily by progressive rock.\nAlbum information\n\nFrost and Fire was produced by Cirith Ungol and originally released through Liquid Flames Records in 1980. The album was re-released in 1981 by Enigma Records, re-released again along with King of the Dead on one CD by One Way Records in 1995, and finally re-released again in September 1999 on Metal Blade Records. A bootleg picture disc version of this LP, limited to 500 hand-numbered copies, also exists. While Michael &quot;Flint&quot; Vujejia is credited as the bass player on this album, it has been confirmed in several interviews that Greg Lindstrom was actually the bassist on this album.\nCritical reception\nProfessional ratings\nReview scores\nSource \tRating\nAllmusic \t3/5 stars[2]\nMetal Reviews \t91/100[3]\n\nIn 2005, Frost and Fire was ranked number 362 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time.\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Greg Lindstrom\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Frost and Fire&quot;   \t3:35\n2. \t&quot;I'm Alive&quot;   \t4:58\n3. \t&quot;A Little Fire&quot;   \t3:46\n4. \t&quot;What Does It Take&quot;   \t3:36\n5. \t&quot;Edge of a Knife&quot;   \t4:29\n6. \t&quot;Better Off Dead&quot;   \t4:45\n7. \t&quot;Maybe That's Why&quot; (instrumental) \t6:15\n8. \t&quot;Cirith Ungol&quot; (live; remastered CD version bonus track) \t8:19\nPersonnel\nBand members\n\n    Tim Baker - lead and backing vocals\n    Jerry Fogle - guitars\n    Greg Lindstrom - guitars, synthetizers, e-bow, backing vocals, bass (uncredited)\n    Michael &quot;Flint&quot; Vujea - bass\n    Robert Garven - drums, backing vocals\n\nProduction\n\n    Tim Nelson - engineer\n    Allen Zentz - mastering\n    Randall L.

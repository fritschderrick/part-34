His name is Lester Long and when the bodies start piling up he generously decides to share the blame. Now the F.B.I. has got the whole town under observation, and Lester has put his new friend Clay over a Barrel. The only way for Clay to set things straight is to beat one twisted individual at his own game of deceit and double-crossing.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d838f20bee80bb61348ce18e12e57824b5dfc03","amp;dn":"Clay+Pigeons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d838f20bee80bb61348ce18e12e57824b5dfc03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,131,143,32,190,232,11,182,19,72,206,24,225,46,87,130,75,93,252,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

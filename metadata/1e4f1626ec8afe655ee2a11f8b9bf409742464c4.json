Our heroes find themselves at the heart of a jungle where a group of strange monkeys are giving them hell, and even party member Calista will end up putting her friends in peril. Granite and Narvarth tread delicately through the wilds of Ythaq, but at the end of the day, are they simply pawns in someone else's game? Who is playing this dangerous game with their lives? In this game, anything is possible, there are no rules... and the competition is fierce!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e4f1626ec8afe655ee2a11f8b9bf409742464c4","amp;dn":"Ythaq+-+No+Escape+03+%28of+03%29+%282009%29+%28Minutemen-DTs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e4f1626ec8afe655ee2a11f8b9bf409742464c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,79,22,38,236,138,254,101,94,226,161,31,139,155,244,9,116,36,100,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

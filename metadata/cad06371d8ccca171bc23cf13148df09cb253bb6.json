Compton, J.D. Wadhawan (RSC, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nRelaunching in 2012, the Specialist Periodical Report, Electrochemistry presents comprehensive and critical reviews in all aspects of the field. T Specialist Periodical Reports present comprehensive and critical reviews of the current literature, with contributions from across the globe. Relaunching in 2012 with a new editorial team (Compton and Wadhawan) the eleventh volume of Electrochemistry has a special focus on Nanosystems. Uniquely, this series will include a review of Chinese literature - opening up this expanse of information to the rest of the word. Topics examined in this volume include: Nanopore systems, metal organic frameworks, nanoparticles, nanocarbon electrochemistry, bipolar electrochemistry in nanosscience and electrochemistry with liquid nanosystems. This volume is a key reference in the field of electrochemistry, allowing the reader to easily become aquainted with the lastest research and opinion.

This show, the third of three at this venue recorded for the King Biscuit Flower Hour, is another great example of why the flamboyant rocker we all know as &quot;Rod The Mod&quot; is truly one of the most gifted performers still doing it today.\n\nStewart opens with the raucous &quot;Hot Legs&quot; and offers an amazing evening that includes hit ballads (&quot;Tonight's The Night,&quot; &quot;You're In My Heart,&quot; and Delaney &amp; Bonnie's classic, &quot;I Don't Want To Talk About It&quot;) against pop dance tracks such as &quot;Da Ya Think I'm Sexy&quot; and &quot;The Wild Side Of Life.&quot; The big solo hits &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; and &quot;You Wear It Well&quot; are other highpoints, and prove that these compositions have perfectly weathered the test of time.\n\nThere are plenty of covers including the Beatles' &quot;Get Back,&quot; Chuck Berry's &quot;Sweet Little Rock 'N' Roller,&quot; and a vicious medley of the Temptations' &quot;(I Know) I'm Losing You&quot; coupled with the Four Tops' &quot;Standing In The Shadows of Love.&quot; Stewart also does a passionate take on the 1972 soul classic, &quot;If Loving You Is Wrong (I Don't Want To be Right).&quot;\n\nThese shows all climax with Stewart's version of Gavin Sutherland's &quot;Sailing,&quot; which was a minor hit in the U.S. but remains one of Britain's largest selling singles, and the encore classic, &quot;Twisting The Night Away,&quot; which was originally a Sam Cooke hit.\n\nStewart had a red hot band that included former Vanilla Fudge/Cactus drummer Carmine Appice who co-authored &quot;Da Ya Think I'm Sexy&quot; and had originally planned to work with Stewart when the ill-fated merger of the Fudge rhythm section with guitarist Jeff Beck Group in 1969 fell apart after Beck's near-fatal car crash.\n\nStewart had departed from the Faces three years prior, but this show was very much still in the Faces-sounding tradition. Since most of the Faces played on the '70s-era Stewart solo albums, it is all a musical blur between his own hits and those of the band.\n\n1. Introduction Music 1:54\n2. Hot Legs 5:31\n3.

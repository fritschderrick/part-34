He shows us a &quot;fuck her right in the pussy&quot; shout out video, a video of possibly the worst comic ever, one of a &quot;know it all&quot; in a courthouse, and Keith tells us about the first time he used a Taser. Ant gets into Rat's lack of a past, tells us how the conversation really goes down in the gaming community, and he examines using your real name versus being anonymous online. Ant introduces us to a TV show called &quot;Girlfriend Intervention&quot; as well as a new Snoop Dogg video and the double standards surrounding them, and then FINALLY, Beavis makes an appearance. He ends today by talking about a &quot;freak show&quot; on TLC and by braving a few more calls.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4fce36b08f81df23ed4a386474334d901bed04e","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-09-03+%28MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4fce36b08f81df23ed4a386474334d901bed04e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,252,227,107,8,248,29,242,62,212,163,134,71,67,52,217,1,190,208,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

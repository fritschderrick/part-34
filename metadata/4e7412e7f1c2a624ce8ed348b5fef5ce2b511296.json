Beyond the MTV-perfect hairdos, the quartet offered a savvy musical blend that suggested crossing Duran Duran with Def Leppard -- just the sort of thing you'd figure would have gone over huge in the heartland. It didn't, but Platinum Blonde had perfected the formula anyway on the single &quot;Crying Over You,&quot; adding squalling guitar from Rush's Alex Lifeson to the polished dance groove. Close behind were the muscular metallic funk of &quot;Red Light&quot; and &quot;Animal,&quot; while the keyboard-laced melodies of &quot;Somebody Somewhere&quot; and &quot;Hungry Eyes&quot; made those songs obvious hits to everyone -- except U.S. listeners. Sometimes the band ventured a little too close to Simon LeBon and co., especially on &quot;Lost in Space,&quot; which sounded like an outtake from Duran Duran. And given that singer Mark Holmes' occasional vocal excesses mirrored LeBon's, it wasn't always a flattering comparison. But ultimately, that's a small quarrel with an album that rolled most of what was fun, colorful, and catchy about '80s music into one still-impressive package.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e7412e7f1c2a624ce8ed348b5fef5ce2b511296","amp;dn":"Platinum+Blonde...Alien+Shores%281985%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e7412e7f1c2a624ce8ed348b5fef5ce2b511296","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,116,18,231,241,194,166,36,206,142,211,72,181,254,245,206,43,81,18,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

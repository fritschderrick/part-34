Having begun Aikido as a boy in France in 1962, Tissier spent eight years in Japan at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo in Tokyo training with many of the artÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s top masters. On his return to his native France, he brought back a new kind of Aikido that soon captured the imagination of the Aikido world in his country and practitioners throughout Europe. Tissier is at present the leading figure in the FFAAA organization, one of FranceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s two large Aikido associations. He is the sole foreign instructor to have taught at the International Aikido World Congress.&quot;\n\n-------------------------\n\nRelease Notes:\n\nVideo codec: x264 (high quality settings, 2 pass, 1021 kbit/sec)\nAudio codec: LAME mp3 v3.98 (VBR: V5)\n\nThe video quality in this release has been improved*, compared to the previous release.

The film, produced by J. Miles Dale and BÃƒÂ¡rbara Muschietti, with Guillermo del Toro serving as executive producer, is based on the Argentine Muschietti's MamÃƒÂ¡, a 2008 Spanish-language short film of the same name that captured del Toro's attention.\n\nThe film deals with the story of two young girls abandoned in a forest cabin, fostered by an unknown entity that they fondly call Mama, which eventually follows them to their new suburban home after their uncle retrieves them. Originally set for an October 2012 release, it was released in theaters on 18 January 2013.\n\nOn the onset of the 2008 financial crisis, a distraught man, Jeffrey, kills his business partners and estranged wife before taking his children Ã¢â‚¬â€œ three-year-old Victoria and one-year-old Lilly Ã¢â‚¬â€œ away from home. Driving dangerously fast on a snowy road, the car slides off the road, down the mountain and crashes in the woods. Surviving, Jeffrey takes the children into an abandoned cabin and builds a fire. Planning to kill his daughters and commit suicide, he holds a gun to Victoria's head, but a shadowy figure drags him away and snaps his neck. Victoria turns around, but cannot see what is going on due to her glasses being previously taken by her father (so as to obscure his gun in plain sight from her bad eyes). The girls, huddled by the fireside, are tossed a cherry by the mysterious figure.\n\nFive years later a rescue party, sponsored by Jeffrey's brother Lucas, finds Victoria and Lilly alive, but dirty, half-naked, and animal-like in their behavior. The girls are put in a welfare clinic under the psychiatric care of Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss. They make reference to &quot;Mama&quot;, a maternal protector figure. When Lucas tries to communicate with the girls, they are initially hostile, but Victoria recognizes him after he gives her a pair of glasses and she can see him properly. Dreyfuss agrees to support Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel's custody claim against the girls' maternal great-aunt Jean. In exchange, they must move into a clinic-owned house and grant Dreyfuss continued contact with Victoria and Lilly for research purposes.\n\nAs Annabel tries to introduce the children to a normal life, she grows convinced of an evil presence in their house. Are the sisters experiencing traumatic stress, or is a ghost coming to visit them? How did the broken girls survive those years all by themselves? As she answers these disturbing questions, the new mother will find that the whispers she hears at bedtime are coming from the lips of a deadly presence.\n\nCAST:\nJessica Chastain as Annabel Moore\nNikolaj Coster-Waldau as Lucas Desange / Jeffrey Desange\nMegan Charpentier as Victoria Desange\nMorgan McGarry as Young Victoria\nIsabelle NÃƒÂ©lisse as Lilly Desange\nMaya and Sierra Dawe as Young Lilly\nDaniel Kash as Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss\nJavier Botet as Mama\nJane Moffat as Jean Podolski / Voice of Mama\nLaura Guiteras as Voice of Mama\nMelina Matthews as Voice of Mama\nDavid Fox as Burnsie\nJulia Chantrey as Nina\nElva Mai Hoover as Secretary\nDominic Cuzzocrea as Ron\nDiane Gordon as Louise\nHannah Cheesman as Beautiful Mama (Edith Brennan) / Skinny Woman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c0fd1aebc712be71856b0d9cafb94e56f954ea4","amp;dn":"Mama+%282013%29+HD+Bluray+Rip+X264+English+AC3+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c0fd1aebc712be71856b0d9cafb94e56f954ea4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,15,209,174,188,113,43,231,24,86,176,217,202,251,148,229,111,149,78,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

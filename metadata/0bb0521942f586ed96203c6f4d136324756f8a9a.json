Interested participants are invited to try, and comment (chech forum link bellow).\n\nBitcoin client version 0.7.1, which just entered testing, includes a new feature:\n\nIf the file &quot;bootstrap.dat&quot; is found in the bitcoin data directory, it will validate and import all blockchain data found in that file. The following torrent presents a bootstrap.dat file for that feature.\n\nWhat is bootstrap.dat?\n\nIt is a flat, binary file containing bitcoin blockchain data, from the genesis block through height 193,000.  Height 193,000 is the height of the current checkpoint baked into the reference client.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=117982.0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=117982.0&lt;/a&gt;\n\nJump in and seed, thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bb0521942f586ed96203c6f4d136324756f8a9a","amp;dn":"Bitcoin+blockchain+torrent+project+%28BETA%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bb0521942f586ed96203c6f4d136324756f8a9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,176,82,25,66,245,134,237,150,32,60,111,77,19,99,36,117,111,138,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

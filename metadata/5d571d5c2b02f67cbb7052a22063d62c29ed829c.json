But her mother's sudden death brings on a dark time for Coriander, and after mourning her beloved mother and dealing with the disappearance of her father and the wrath of her evil stepmother, Coriander finds herself locked in a chest with no hope of escape and no will to survive. But when a bright light beckons to her, it is then that Coriander's journey truly begins. Beautifully written, this magical and luminous story is destined to become a children's classic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d571d5c2b02f67cbb7052a22063d62c29ed829c","amp;dn":"I+Coriander+-+Sally+Gardner.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d571d5c2b02f67cbb7052a22063d62c29ed829c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,87,29,92,43,2,246,124,187,112,82,162,32,99,214,44,41,237,130,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

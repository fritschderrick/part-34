We discover that a staggering amount of previously published endgame analysis is simply wrong, and that many of the standard guidelines are at best partially true.\n\nThis first volume covers general topics and discusses in detail pawn endings, queen endings and minor-piece endings.\n\nAbout the Author\nDr John Nunn is one of the best-respected figures in world chess. He was among the world's leading grandmasters for nearly twenty years, winning four gold medals in chess Olympiads and finishing sixth overall in the World Cup in 1989. He is a much-acclaimed writer, whose works have won 'Book of the Year' awards in several countries. In both 2004 and 2007 Nunn was crowned World Chess Solving Champion, ahead of many former champions.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Nunns-Chess-Endings-John-Nunn/dp/1906454213/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1326902850&amp;sr=8-5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Nunns-Chess-Endings-John-Nunn/dp/1906454213/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1326902850&amp;sr=8-5&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ba53a872eb0a88fafcc43a28af2030118c9d446","amp;dn":"John+Nunn%3A+Chess+Endings%2C+2+vols.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ba53a872eb0a88fafcc43a28af2030118c9d446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,165,58,135,46,176,168,143,175,204,67,162,138,242,3,1,24,201,212,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

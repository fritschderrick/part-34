The film is a character study of the kind of person who willingly &quot;conforms&quot; to the ideological fashions of his day. In this case, director Bernardo Bertolucci suggests that Marcello's desire to conform is rooted in his latent homosexuality. In addition to its strong storyline, the film is critically revered for the astonishing production design by Nedo Azzini, which, together with Vittorio Storaro's camerawork, recreates the atmosphere of Fascist Italy with some of the most complex visual compositions ever seen on film, filled with highly stylized uses of angles, shapes, and shadows. \n\nFile Name .........................................: Il conformista.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,560,788,992 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:52:52\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x432 (AR: 1.667)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1642 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.220 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065571/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065571/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Italian\nSubtitles: English (idx/sub), Portuguese (srt)\n\nPosted originally at KG by EceAyhan, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74011d87464612bb91c4a70c7ade1311d319eb42","amp;dn":"Il+conformista+%28Bertolucci%2C+1970%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74011d87464612bb91c4a70c7ade1311d319eb42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,1,29,135,70,70,18,187,145,196,167,12,122,222,19,17,211,25,235,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The defendant was a 27-year-old woman, accused of the murders of three babies. She was not their mother, but had adopted them by a crude means known as 'baby farming.'\r\nBut Jessie King had no intention of keeping the babies she had taken in for money. Vulnerable, uneducated and penniless, the young woman struggled to survive. She appeared willing to do whatever was asked of her, by anyone she saw as a figure of authority.\r\nCould it be that Jessie's lover took advantage of her easily manipulated nature? 30 years her senior, and an unemployed alcoholic, Thomas Pearson had to find ways and means to feed his addiction... With expert opinion and drama reconstruction, the programme is presented by John Morrison.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/05/Baby-Killer-The-Jessie-King-Story-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3d/Baby-Killer-The-Jessie-King-Story-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1a/Baby-Killer-The-Jessie-King-Story-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0d/Baby-Killer-The-Jessie-King-Story-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/05/Baby-Killer-The-Jessie-King-Story-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e4/Baby-Killer-The-Jessie-King-Story-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/84/Baby-Killer-The-Jessie-King-Story-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/20/Baby-Killer-The-Jessie-King-Story-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f0/Baby-Killer-The-Jessie-King-Story-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~1000Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1024x576\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.42 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2 (Gaelic)\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 477 MB\r\n * Source: PDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Embedded English\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04z1lmb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f37eb1450799a49ca5e9ab826f393a08efae0d56","amp;dn":"BBC+Baby+Killer+The+Jessie+King+Story+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f37eb1450799a49ca5e9ab826f393a08efae0d56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,126,177,69,7,153,164,156,165,233,171,130,111,57,58,8,239,174,13,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

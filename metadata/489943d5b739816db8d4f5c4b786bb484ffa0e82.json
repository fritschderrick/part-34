Michael recovers from scarlet fever and seeks out Hanna to thank her. The two are quickly drawn into a passionate but secretive affair. Michael discovers that Hanna loves being read to and their physical relationship deepens. Hanna is enthralled as Michael reads to her from &quot;The Odyssey,&quot; &quot;Huck Finn&quot; and &quot;The Lady with the Little Dog.&quot; Despite their intense bond, Hanna mysteriously disappears one day and Michael is left confused and heartbroken. Eight years later, while Michael is a law student observing the Nazi war crime trials, he is stunned to find Hanna back in his life - this time as a defendant in the courtroom. As Hanna's past is revealed, Michael uncovers a deep secret that will impact both of their lives. THE READER is a story about truth and reconciliation, about how one generation comes to terms with the crimes of another. \n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/6241/vlcsnap2010112901h13m39.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/6241/vlcsnap2010112901h13m39.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/1643/vlcsnap2010112901h13m18.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/1643/vlcsnap2010112901h13m18.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/3287/vlcsnap2010112901h13m23.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/3287/vlcsnap2010112901h13m23.png&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:489943d5b739816db8d4f5c4b786bb484ffa0e82","amp;dn":"The+Reader+%282008%29+m-HD+450MB+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"489943d5b739816db8d4f5c4b786bb484ffa0e82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,153,67,213,183,57,129,109,184,212,245,196,183,134,187,72,79,250,14,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

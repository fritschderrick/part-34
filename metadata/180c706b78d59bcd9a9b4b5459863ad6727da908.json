Sutton, &quot;America&amp;#039;s Secret Establishment: An Introduction to the Order of Skull &amp; Bones&quot;\n-------\nAntony C. Sutton, &quot;America&amp;#039;s Secret Establishment: An Introduction to the Order of Skull &amp; Bones&quot;\nTrine Day | ISBN 0972020705 | 2003 Year | PDF | 10,81 Mb | 335 Pages\n\nFor 170 years they have met in secret. From out of their initiates come presidents, senators, judges, cabinet secretaries, and plenty of spooks. They are the titans of finance and industry and have now installed a third member as United States President George W. Bush. This intriguing behind-the-scenes look documents Yale&amp;#039;s secretive society, the Order of the Skull and Bones, and its prominent members, numbering among them Tafts, Rockefellers, Pillsburys, and Bushes. Far from being a campus fraternity, the society is more concerned with the success of its members in the post-collegiate world. Included are a verified membership list, rare reprints of original Order materials revealing the interlocking power centers dominated by Bonesmen, and a peek inside the Tomb, their 140-year-old private clubhouse.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:180c706b78d59bcd9a9b4b5459863ad6727da908","amp;dn":"America%5C%27s+Secret+Establishment+-+An+Introduction+To+The+Order","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"180c706b78d59bcd9a9b4b5459863ad6727da908","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,12,112,107,120,213,155,205,154,155,75,84,89,134,58,214,114,125,169,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

His guides are California surfer and computer   :\n : whiz Barrett Lyon and a fearless British high-tech agent. Through these    :\n : heroes, Menn shows the evolution of cyber-crime from small-time thieving to:\n : sophisticated, organized gangs, who began by attacking corporate websites  :\n : but increasingly steal financial data from consumers and defense secrets   :\n : from governments. Using unprecedented access to Mob businesses and Russian :\n : officials, the book reveals how top criminals earned protection from the   :\n : Russian government. Fatal System Error penetrates both the Russian         :\n : cyber-mob and La Cosa Nostra as the two fight over the Internet's massive  :\n : spoils. The cloak-and-dagger adventure shows why cyber-crime is much worse :\n : than you thought--and why the Internet might not survive.                  :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ea723bbddba30c6fc3fc90667b1e703193d2924","amp;dn":"Joseph+Menn+Fatal+System+Error+2010+Retail+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ea723bbddba30c6fc3fc90667b1e703193d2924","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,167,35,187,221,186,48,198,252,63,201,6,103,177,231,3,25,61,41,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Originally this was nothing more than a hobby but with the value of gold apparently on a increasing trend, what started out as just a hobby has now become a means of creating gold bullion as a long term investment. And so, I figured that now would be a perfect opportunity to share my experience in gold refining at home with you. Not only you will end up being able to create 99.9% pure 24K gold, but you will also see how ridiculously simple and easy is the process of extracting gold and the equipment is easly optainable and very inexpensive. In fact, over the years I`ve simplified the entire process so that everyone can do it. So, buy the book and give it a go.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lulu.com/shop/daniel-labo/easy-steps-to-gold-refining-at-home/ebook/product-20504274.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lulu.com/shop/daniel-labo/easy-steps-to-gold-refining-at-home/ebook/product-20504274.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae6b1f70ea64859cf67771340be685ec566d7901","amp;dn":"Easy+Steps+to+Gold+Refining+at+Home+By+Daniel+Labo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae6b1f70ea64859cf67771340be685ec566d7901","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,107,31,112,234,100,133,156,246,119,113,52,11,230,133,236,86,109,121,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

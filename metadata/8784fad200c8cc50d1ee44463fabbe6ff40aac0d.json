But rather than just complain about it or give up on the system, we must join together and make it work for all of us.\n\nIn this timely book, Robert B. Reich argues that nothing good happens in Washington unless citizens are energized and organized to make sure Washington acts in the public good. The first step is to see the big picture. Beyond Outrage connects the dots, showing why the increasing share of income and wealth going to the top has hobbled jobs and growth for everyone else, undermining our democracy; caused Americans to become increasingly cynical about public life; and turned many Americans against one another. He also explains why the proposals of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“regressive rightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are dead wrong and provides a clear roadmap of what must be done instead.\n\nHereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a plan for action for everyone who cares about the future of America.\n--------------\n\n\nFrom Booklist\nThe problem with our economy is that it currently works for the fewÃ¢â‚¬â€corporate and Wall Street elitesÃ¢â‚¬â€at the expense of the rest of us, former labor secretary Reich argues. Elites not only receive higher compensation but enjoy greater job security. Ã¢â‚¬Å“RegressivesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€politicians who have been co-opted by big moneyÃ¢â‚¬â€have turned the question of American morality upside down. These regressive forces push a divide-and-conquer strategy, primarily by raising alarms over deficit spending and asserting a need to cut public programs that benefit the middle class and the poor. Reich notes the blame heaped on public employees for state budget crises in comparison to that accorded either Wall Street practices that led to the recession or the Supreme CourtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Citizens United decision that removed limitations on corporate contributions to political campaigns. Reich recommends that politicians and the public get out of their ideological bubbles and face the need to raise tax rates on the wealthy, reduce military spending, and restrict the size of banks to reduce the risk to taxpayers in case of failure. --Vernon Ford\n\n---------------\n\nAbout the Author\nRobert B.

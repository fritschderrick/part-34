Anyway here is some of it....... Abbott once said in a Guitar World interview that if there were no Ace Frehley, there would have been no Dimebag Darrell who even had a tattoo of the KISS guitarist on his chest. Frehley signed the tattoo in pen ink upon meeting him, at Dimebag's request, and the autograph was later tattooed over.\n\nAbbott stated in various interviews that his riffs were largely influenced by Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath. Iommi also influenced Dimebag's guitar tone and tunings, which often went down to C# or lower. Pantera covered Black Sabbath songs &quot;Planet Caravan&quot;, &quot;Hole in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Electric Funeral&quot;. Eddie Van Halen was another big influence on his style. He learned &quot;Eruption&quot; note-for-note and often played it live in his early days.\n\nPete Willis of Def Leppard was seen as another major influence for Darrell. In his Guitar World magazine tribute issue, Abbott was quoted as saying, &quot;Man, that first Leppard album really jams, and their original guitarist, Pete Willis, was a great player. I was inspired by him because I was a small young dude and he was a small young dude, tooÃ¢â‚¬â€and he was out there kickin' ass. He made me want to get out there and play. Def Leppard used the two-guitar thing much more back then than they do now.&quot;\n\nHe also cited Kerry King of Slayer, Zakk Wylde of Black Label Society and James Hetfield of Metallica as other important influences. In the late 1980s, around the time of Power Metal, Abbott often covered songs by guitarist Joe Satriani, such as &quot;Crushing Day&quot;. He also incorporated elements of Satriani songs like &quot;Echo&quot; into his live solos as well. Dimebag mentioned in an interview with Guitar World that the clean chord passages in the intro to &quot;Cemetery Gates&quot; were influenced by the clean chordal passages found in much of Ty Tabor's (King's X) playing. As with Billy Gibbons, Abbott frequently made use of pentatonic scales and pinch harmonics in both his leads and rhythms. Both guitarists employ blues scales, start / stop dynamics and pedal tones, as in Abbott's southern style riff in &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot; and the main riff to ZZ Top's &quot;Tush&quot;.\n\nRandy Rhoads-style chord arpeggios can be heard in much of Abbott's playing as well, noted examples being &quot;Floods&quot;, &quot;Shedding Skin&quot;, &quot;The Sleep&quot; and &quot;This Love&quot;. Three of Abbott's solos were ranked in Guitar World magazine's Top 100 of all-time: &quot;Walk&quot; (No. 57), &quot;Cemetery Gates&quot; (No. 35), and &quot;Floods&quot; (No. 15). Abbott stated that &quot;Eddie Van Halen was heavy rock and roll, but Randy was heavy metal&quot;.\n\nEddie Van Halen, whom Abbott had befriended, placed his original black with yellow stripes guitar (commonly called &quot;bumblebee&quot;) into the Kiss Kasket Abbott was buried in. Abbott had mentioned that those colors were his favorite combination, and Van Halen had agreed to craft a copy for Abbott only several months before his untimely death. However, upon hearing of the tragedy, he offered to place the original guitar in the casket. According to Darrell's girlfriend Rita, Van Halen stated: &quot;Dime was an original and only an original deserves the original!&quot;. Vinnie Paul Abbott is cited to have said &quot;If he had known he would be buried with this guitar, he would have said 'shoot me now!'&quot;. Abbott credited Vito Rulez of Chauncy for convincing him to try Bill Lawrence pickups.\n\nAccording to an interview with Dino Cazares of Fear Factory, Abbott told him that during the recording of Reinventing the Steel he compared his guitar tone with Dino's. Incidentally, during the making of Fear Factory's Demanufacture, Cazares compared his guitar tone to that of Vulgar Display of Power.\nEquipment. And this kind of of dialog goes on for a long time in fact I believe it still is only got to see him once myself. Wish for more.........Little Wing done by Darrell &quot;Dimebag&quot; Abbott Get it...............","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fff99be809195cd9b70c19ef4521ced3ab195547","amp;dn":"Dimebag%27s++Little+Wing+128k++mp3+++++ak10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fff99be809195cd9b70c19ef4521ced3ab195547","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,249,155,232,9,25,92,217,183,12,25,239,69,33,206,211,171,25,85,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

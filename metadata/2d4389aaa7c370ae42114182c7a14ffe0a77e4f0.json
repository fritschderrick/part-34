There are two tributes to Billy Strayhorn (including a version of &quot;Star Crossed Lovers&quot;), one for George Russell, a remake of &quot;The Crips&quot; and a pair of features for the koto. A very interesting program of adventurous yet quite logical explorations. ~ Scott Yanow\n \nPersonnel:\nJames Newton - flute\nCharles Owens - English horn, soprano sax \nJohn Carter - clarinet\nAllan Iwohara - koto\nRed Callender - tuba\nGreg Martin - oboe\nJohn Nunez - bassoon\nRoberto Miranda - bass\nAnthony Brown - percussion\n\nJames Newton - Water Mystery Tracks:\n01  Star Crossed Lovers\n02  Lone Hill\n03  The Crips\n04  Water Mystery\n05  One For Strayhorn\n06  Dance Steps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d4389aaa7c370ae42114182c7a14ffe0a77e4f0","amp;dn":"James+Newton+-+Water+Mystery+%281985%29+%5Bjazz%5D%5Bflac%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d4389aaa7c370ae42114182c7a14ffe0a77e4f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,67,137,170,167,195,112,174,66,17,65,130,199,161,79,254,10,119,228,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Significant recent progress has been made in the fundamental understanding of the events leading to bread staling. Bread Staling presents current knowledge from a physico-chemical perspective, with the intent of providing applicable methods to improve product shelf-life and to design new and longer-lasting baked goods. The contributors detail how to solve this food problem by using polymer science, material research, and molecular spectroscopy, which is a new way to approach a centuries-old problem. This approach can aid manufacturers in developing anti-staling formulations for bread and other baked products. The non-traditional areas of research presented in this book, such as the glassy-rubbery transition and its relevance to bread staling, provide crucial information for scientists and engineers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88e266fd6eec8a28068a762891fb6e7efdd1aff5","amp;dn":"Bread+Staling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88e266fd6eec8a28068a762891fb6e7efdd1aff5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,226,102,253,110,236,138,40,6,138,118,40,145,251,110,126,253,209,175,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

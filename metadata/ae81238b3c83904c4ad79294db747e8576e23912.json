Part 1.\n                Children's drama series from the makers of Doctor\n                Who, following the adventures of investigative\n                journalist Sarah Jane Smith. Joseph Serf has launched\n                his new SerfBoard, the must-have computer that no one\n                can resist owning. Intrigued, Sarah Jane takes Luke\n                and Sky to investigate what is so compelling about\n                Serf and his business. Meanwhile Clyde and Rani take\n                a SerfBoard to pieces, suspecting alien technology\n                may be the answer. Everyone wants the brand new\n                SerfBoard - and why not? What could be so dangerous\n                about a computer?\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae81238b3c83904c4ad79294db747e8576e23912","amp;dn":"The.Sarah.Jane.Adventures.S05E05.WS.PDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae81238b3c83904c4ad79294db747e8576e23912","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,129,35,139,60,131,144,76,74,215,146,148,219,116,126,133,118,226,57,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

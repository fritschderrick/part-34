Both characters have unique stories and endings. However, there is some crossover between both plots. The vast majority of the gameplay focuses on the use of a magical set of cards, which can provide useful resources, labor, weapons, and magic spells. Throughout the game the player will receive new cards that can be combined with older cards, thus creating more powerful and creative abilities. Along the way players will have to think about how to use these abilities to gain tactical advantages. Characters designed by Yoshitaka Amano (FINAL FANTASY) inhabit 3D battlefields that can be rotated for the best view. With two separate quests and a large number of abilities to discover, KARTIA will keep the player busy for quite some time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75f0f51441badcb77c992a178f710de339f8dcc3","amp;dn":"%28PSX-PSP%29+Kartia%3AThe+Word+Of+Fate+converted+properly+%28Kingdom-ga","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75f0f51441badcb77c992a178f710de339f8dcc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,240,245,20,65,186,220,183,124,153,42,23,143,113,13,227,57,248,220,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

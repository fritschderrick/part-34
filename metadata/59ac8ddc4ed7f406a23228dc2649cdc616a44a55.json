CrileÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book is the true story of how a Texas Congressman and a rogue CIA agent conspired to launch the biggest, meanest, and most successful CIA campaign ever Ã¢â‚¬â€ the operation to fund the mujahideen in their fight against the Soviet army that had invaded Afghanistan. Moving from the back rooms of the Capitol to secret chambers at Langley, from arms dealersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ conventions to the Khyber Pass, Charlie WilsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s War presents an astonishing chapter of our recent past, and the key to understanding what helped trigger the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union and ultimately led to the emergence of a brand-new foe in the form of radical Islam.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59ac8ddc4ed7f406a23228dc2649cdc616a44a55","amp;dn":"Charlie+Wilson%27s+War%3A+The+Extraordinary+Story+of+How+the+Wildest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59ac8ddc4ed7f406a23228dc2649cdc616a44a55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,172,141,220,78,215,244,6,162,50,40,220,38,73,205,198,22,164,74,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

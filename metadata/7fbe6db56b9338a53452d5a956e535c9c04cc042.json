I am in the process of collecting the entire discography and am releasing the rips piecemeal until my collection is complete. Ultimately I wish to provide the scans from the inserts as well (whenever I get a scanner). I ripped the cd using the linux &quot;abcde&quot; script and tagged with &quot;easytag.&quot; This is my first torrent so go easy on the criticisms.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fbe6db56b9338a53452d5a956e535c9c04cc042","amp;dn":"Sweatshop+Union+-+Water+Street+%282008%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fbe6db56b9338a53452d5a956e535c9c04cc042","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,190,109,181,107,147,56,165,52,82,213,169,86,229,53,201,192,76,192,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

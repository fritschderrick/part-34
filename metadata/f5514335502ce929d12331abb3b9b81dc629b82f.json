This haunting adaptation of Ursula K. Le Guin's genre-classic novel was broadcast but once on PBS in 1980 before rights and other legal snafus relegated it to the archives. Reportedly PBS's most requested program, the made-for-TV film was at last rebroadcast in 2000. Set in Portland, Oregon, in the near future, The Lathe of Heaven stars Bruce Davison as George Orr, who, to put it mildly, has a dream problem. Not only do his dreams come true, but they &quot;change reality back to the Stone Age.&quot;\n\nKevin Conway costars as Dr. Haber, a dream specialist who instantly recognizes George's gift and tries to harness it to make the whole world right. But, as George notes, &quot;Unlimited power means unlimited danger.&quot; The increasingly megalomaniacal Haber uses George to try to cure the world's ills, from overpopulation to war, resulting in, for starters, a devastating plague and even alien invasion.\n\n\n\n IMDb.............: User Rating of 7.2/10\n\n Year.............: 1980\n Country..........: USA\n Runtime..........: 105 Minutes\n Audio............: LANGUAGE(S) English - Dolby Stereo\n Subtitles........: English\n Video Format.....: NTSC\n Aspect Ratio.....:  4:3, 1.33:1\n DVD Format.......: Non-Anamorphic\n DVD Source.......: DVD5\n DVD Distributor..: New Video Group\n Program..........: DVD Decrypter\n Average Bit Rate.: 5.42 Mb/sec - Average\n\nMenus............: [X] Untouched\n                  [ ] Stripped\n\nVideo............: [X] Untouched\n                  [ ] Re-encoded\n\nDVD-extras.......: [X] Untouched\n                  [ ] Stripped\n                  [ ] Re-encoded\n                  [ ] None\n\nDVD-Audio........: [X] Untouched\n                  [ ] Stripped tracks\n\nExtras:\n .

No matter how big or how small a fan of sci-fi you are, you can certainly appreciate it.  The remake made years later doesnt live up to this by any means.\n\nTo put it simply, an absolutely stunning film that should be on everyones must-see list.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5514335502ce929d12331abb3b9b81dc629b82f","amp;dn":"The+Lathe+of+Heaven+%281980%29+NTSC+DVD5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5514335502ce929d12331abb3b9b81dc629b82f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,81,67,53,80,44,233,41,209,35,49,171,179,185,184,29,198,41,184,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

From the early quest of the Mercury program to put a man in space, to the historic moon landings, through the Soyuz link-up and the first un-tethered space walk by Bruce McCandless, this is how the space age came of age. The vivid HD series features vintage rushes and all the key onboards filmed by the astronauts themselves. The sequences are captured by cameras onboard the spaceships, enabling the series to tell the stories in a depth never seen before.\nIMDB # tt1233514\n\n\none file, .avi format\n624 x 352\n24 fps\n128 kbs audio\n1 hr 27 minutes\n\nKindly seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b75e73c3a253bdcc7ac16d86399a2108f337c7fe","amp;dn":"when+we+left+earth+the+nasa+missions+part+2+hdtv+xvid-fqm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b75e73c3a253bdcc7ac16d86399a2108f337c7fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,94,115,195,162,83,189,204,122,193,109,134,57,154,33,8,243,55,199,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

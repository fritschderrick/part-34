It does include more documentary/info than we do now because that was our original intent with these dvds - enlighten AND entertain our friends and family. Gotta slip that info in with the entertainment or else it will never even be put into the dvd player. The awesome thing is that a lot more artists are speaking out politically now, so the message is in the music and we don't even put anything that stops the music anymore unless it's short and fantastic, which is rare. Big ups to Killer Mike for hitting the mothafuckin nail on the head with this video, &quot;Burn&quot;, as well as all his recent mixtapes and albums.

For other uses, see Gita (disambiguation).\nNot to be confused with Bhagavata Purana.        \n\n\n\nThe epic Mahabaharata is traditionally ascribed to the Sage Ved Vyasa; the Bhagavad Gita, being a part of the Mahabharata, is also ascribed to him. \n \n\n\n\n\nBhagavad Gita comprises 18 chapters (section 25 to 42)[27][web 2] in the Bhishma Parva of the epic Mahabharata and consists of 700 verses.[28] Because of differences in recensions, the verses of the Gita may be numbered in the full text of the Mahabharata as chapters 6.25Ã¢â‚¬â€œ42 or as chapters 6.23Ã¢â‚¬â€œ40.[web 3] According to the recension of the Gita commented on by Adi Shankara, a prominent philosopher of the Vedanta school, the number of verses is 700, but there is evidence to show that old manuscripts had 745 verses.[29] The verses themselves, composed with similes and metaphors, are poetic in nature. The verses mostly employ the range and style of the Sanskrit Anustubh meter (chhandas), and in a few expressive verses the Tristubh meter is used.[30]\n\nThe Sanskrit editions of the Gita name each chapter as a particular form of yoga. However, these chapter titles do not appear in the Sanskrit text of the Mahabharata.[web 3] Swami Chidbhavananda explains that each of the eighteen chapters is designated as a separate yoga because each chapter, like yoga, &quot;trains the body and the mind&quot;. He labels the first chapter &quot;Arjuna Vishada Yogam&quot; or the &quot;Yoga of Arjuna's Dejection&quot;.[31] Sir Edwin Arnold translates this chapter as &quot;The Distress of Arjuna&quot;[32]\nPainting depicting a multi-armed, multi-headed beingÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Vishvarupa of Krishna.\nKrishna displays his Vishvarupa (Universal Form) to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra (chapter 11).\n\n        Gita Dhyanam: (contains 9 verses) The Gita Dhyanam is not a part of the main Bhagavad Gita, but it is commonly published with the GÃ„Â«tÃ„ï¿½ as a prefix. The verses of the Gita Dhyanam (also called GÃ„Â«tÃ„ï¿½ DhyÃ„ï¿½na or DhyÃ„ï¿½na Ã…Å¡lokas) offer salutations to a variety of sacred scriptures, figures, and entities, characterise the relationship of the GÃ„Â«tÃ„ï¿½ to the Upanishads, and affirm the power of divine assistance.[33] It is a common practice to recite these before reading the Gita.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36d048a5992245278c9c70604e7237bf9bd16ecb","amp;dn":"Bhagavad+gita+telugu++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36d048a5992245278c9c70604e7237bf9bd16ecb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,208,72,165,153,34,69,39,140,156,112,96,78,114,55,191,155,209,110,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

But for a genius, he makes an awful lot of music that can best be described as pleasant. Granted that its pleasantness is substantial and sensual and spirited all at once. Granted too that the accomplishment of this album is more reliable than that of his last group effort, Treasure Island. I still expect more from a genius.&quot; B\n- Robert Christgau, Village Voice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e6e380ae38bda907bb7a743edf9bb9ae959c3f8","amp;dn":"Keith+Jarrett+-+Death+and+the+Flower+%281975+quad+mix+24%2F96+lossle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e6e380ae38bda907bb7a743edf9bb9ae959c3f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,110,56,10,227,139,218,144,123,183,167,67,237,249,187,154,233,89,195,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

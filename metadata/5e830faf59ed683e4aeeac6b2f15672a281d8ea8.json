The issues are collected in the book, Star Wars: Clone Wars, vol. 7. That book is found in the listing for Star Wars (becomes Star Wars: Republic).\nThis series is noteworthy as an example of LucasBooks better control over its prequel-era Expanded Universe than its post-ROTJ era. Tying into Episode III, the Clone Wars animated series, the already-established Republic story lines, and the Random House novels of the time frame, it stands as an exemplar of cross-media continuity.\n\nNumber of issues: 5\nFiles format: CBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e830faf59ed683e4aeeac6b2f15672a281d8ea8","amp;dn":"Star+Wars%3A+Obsession+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e830faf59ed683e4aeeac6b2f15672a281d8ea8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,131,15,175,89,237,104,62,74,238,172,107,47,21,103,42,40,29,142,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

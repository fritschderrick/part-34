Flash forward several years and Geordie is now a strapping, muscle-bound, Olympic champ (now portrayed by Bill Travers). Evidently his muscles have spread to his head, for Geordie sees no need for emotional fulfilment, and alienates his girlfriend (Norah Gorsen) on the road to becoming the top-ranked hammer thrower at the Highland Games and the UK representative at the Melbourne Olympics. When Geordie finally falls in love again, it is with towering shot-putter Helga (Doris Goddard) - the first woman ever able to best him on the athletic field.\nSim, unsurprisingly manages to quietly steal the film as the Laird for whom Geordie's father works as a gamekeeper.\n\nFeature Running Time: 95 mins approx.

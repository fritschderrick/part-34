The connection to their tortured history is one of only passing fascination. The reunion turns deadly when the elders have to make good on an ancient pact with a spirit of an ancestor. Now, it's this generation's turn to make the ultimate sacrifice. It is their duty and their destiny, but they won't give up without a fight to survive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78ec0d9da79c8a14ac5ee1e43cb0540a093846ca","amp;dn":"The.Inheritance.2011.DVDRip.FINSUB+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78ec0d9da79c8a14ac5ee1e43cb0540a093846ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,236,13,157,167,156,138,20,172,94,225,228,60,176,84,10,9,56,70,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

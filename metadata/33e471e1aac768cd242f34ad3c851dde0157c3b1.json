In this engaging story Marc relates how, supported by his family and by services for people with autism, and despite family tragedy and personal difficulties, he learnt to get the most out of life. He shares, with humour and candour, a multitude of practical tips for people with AS, and those around them, rounding off his story with appendices on astronomy, parallel universes, and the mathematics of unfeasibly large numbers.\n\nAbout the Author\nMarc Fleisher was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome aged 11. He has since written several articles and spoken publicly on AS and Autism. He has a love for mathematics, holding a masters degree in math, and is a keen sportsman, and tennis instructor for children with disabilities.

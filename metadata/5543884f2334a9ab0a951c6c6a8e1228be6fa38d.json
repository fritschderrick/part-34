Former agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is \nnow a doctor, while Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is being hunted by his former \nagency and living in seclusion. He and Scully are summoned back by a case \ninvolving a missing agent and a former priest (Billy Connolly) who claims to be \nable to see clues to the agent&amp;#039;s whereabouts psychically, though his initial \nsearch turns up only a severed limb. Don&amp;#039;t expect the usual cast of characters; \nthe FBI has completely turned over (except for the George W. Bush portrait), and \nthe only reason Scully and Mulder are back is because agent Dakota Whitney \n(Amanda Peet) remembers his success on similar cases involving the \nunexplainable. Don&amp;#039;t expect the same rogues&amp;#039; gallery either; unlike the previous \nX-Files feature film, which was inextricably linked to the series&amp;#039; convoluted \nmythology arc (and served as a bridge between the fifth and sixth seasons), I \nWant to Believe is a stand-alone piece that makes use of the series&amp;#039; roots in \nhorror/sci-fi and moody Vancouver, B.C., locales. Also unlike the previous film, \nwhich was almost self-consciously shot for the big screen, this film is on a \nsmaller scale, like a double-length episode of the series. But it&amp;#039;s still a good \nreminder of the creepy vibe that hooked fans for years. And the relationship \nbetween Mulder and Scully? It seems to have resumed pretty much where it left \noff, at least when you take into account the long period of separation. But \nstick around for the end-credit sequence to take in all the possibilities for \nthe future.\n\nDirector: Chris Carter\n\nWriters : Frank Spotnitz\n        : Chris Carter\n\nCast    :\n\nDavid Duchovny ...

His archive contains classic moments, like Bill Mazeroski's homer and the Shot Heard 'Round the World; and amazing feats, like Carl Hubbell striking out Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmy Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe Cronin-in order-in the 1934 All-Star Game. Narrated by Bob Costas, Baseball Forever! brings you highlights from Miley's collection, with numerous clips available for the first time since their original transmission. Bestselling author Jason Turbow (The Baseball Codes) mines the archive with Miley himself, taking us to some of baseball's greatest settings-Yankee Stadium, Ebbetts Field, Fenway Park-while guided by the game's legendary broadcasters, like Mel Allen, Red Barber, Harry Caray, and Vin Scully. Miley and Turbow have carefully selected an abundance of highlights for Baseball Forever! that is sure to inform, entertain, and appeal to anybody nostalgic for baseball's storied history.\n\nMeet the Author\nJason Turbow is the author of The Baseball Codes (Pantheon, 2010), which NPR called &quot;one of the allÃ¢â‚¬â€œtime greats,&quot; and writes for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and Sports Illustrated, among other publications.

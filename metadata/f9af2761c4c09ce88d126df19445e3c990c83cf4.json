In its enormous spareness, AkermanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film seems simple, but it encompasses an entire world. Whether seen as an exacting character study or one of cinemaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most hypnotic and complete depictions of space and time, Jeanne Dielman is an astonishing, compelling movie experiment, one that has been analyzed and argued over for decades.\n\nStuff I want as full disc either DVD5 or DVD9:\nStranger on the Third Floor\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9af2761c4c09ce88d126df19445e3c990c83cf4","amp;dn":"Jeanne+Dielman%2C+23+Quai+du+Commerce%2C+1080+Bruxelles+FULL+DVD5+Cr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9af2761c4c09ce88d126df19445e3c990c83cf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,175,39,97,196,192,156,232,141,18,109,241,148,69,227,201,144,200,60,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

After we ve spent a little\ntime setting up or composition, we ll get things started by choosing the\ncolors for the sky in our image. Here we ll learn why colors change so\nmuch at night. We ll also learn about choosing both key and fill lights\nfor our scene. Some of the other topics we will address while working\nthrough this painting are things like atmospheric perspective, reflected\nlight, cast shadows and form shadows as well as the interaction between\ncolored lights.

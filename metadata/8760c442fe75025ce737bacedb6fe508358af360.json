Under the artful lens of cinematographer Christopher Doyle (best known for his work with Wong Kar Wai), Invisible Waves drips with atmosphere as the film travels from Hong Kong and Macau to Thailand. Moody, violent, and beautiful, Invisible Waves takes a quirky, introspective journey towards the root of guilt. In addition to go-to actor Asano Tadanobu, the international cast includes Korean actress Gang Hye Jung (Old Boy), Hong Kong veterans Eric Tsang and Maria Cordero, and Japanese actor Mitsuishi Ken. \n\nJapanese chef Kyoji (Asano Tadanobu) works in a Macau restaurant run by Thai gangsters. On orders from his boss, he kills his lover - who also happens to be the boss's wife. Forced to flee, he jumps on a ship heading to Phuket, Thailand. On the ship, Kyoji meets a motley line-up of strange characters, including a young mother (Gang Hye Jung), a monk (Eric Tsang), an all-knowing matron (Maria Cordero), and an odd hitman (Mitsuishi Ken) who was sent to kill him but instead accompanies him on a bizarre trip through Thailand. Soon even his boss shows up to square old debts. Kyoji's greatest obstacle, however, is his own mind as he comes to terms with his actions.\n\nGenre..........Drama/Thriller\nRuntime........1hr59min\nResolution.....640x352\nVideo..........~1255Kbps XviD\nAudio..........384Kbps AC3\nFrame rate.....23Fps\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8760c442fe75025ce737bacedb6fe508358af360","amp;dn":"Invisible+Waves+%282006%29+-+Pen-Ek+Ratanaruang","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8760c442fe75025ce737bacedb6fe508358af360","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,96,196,66,254,117,2,92,231,55,186,206,219,111,229,8,53,138,243,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

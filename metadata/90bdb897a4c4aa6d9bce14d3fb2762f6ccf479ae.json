As a result, it was their first hit album in the U.S., peaking at number 20 in September of that year. This recording is a primer of British blues-rock of the era, showcasing Alvin Lee's guitar pyrotechnics and the band's propulsive rhythm section. As with most of TYA's work, the lyrics were throwaways, but the music was hot. Featured is a lengthy cover of Sonny Boy Williamson's &quot;Good Morning Little Schoolgirl,&quot; with reworked lyrics leaving little doubt as to what the singer had in mind for the title character. Also included was a 12-bar blues song with the ultimate generic blues title &quot;I Woke Up This Morning.&quot; Ssssh marked the beginning of the band's run of popularity on the U.S. album charts and in the underground FM-radio scene. \n\n1 Bad Scene \n2 Two Time Mama \n3 Stoned Woman \n4 Good Morning Little Schoolgirl \n5 If You Should Love Me \n6 I Don't Know That You Don't Know My Name \n7 The Stomp \n8 I Woke Up This Morning \n\nmp3   320kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90bdb897a4c4aa6d9bce14d3fb2762f6ccf479ae","amp;dn":"Ten+Years+After+-+Ssssh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90bdb897a4c4aa6d9bce14d3fb2762f6ccf479ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,189,184,151,164,196,170,109,155,206,20,211,251,39,98,246,204,244,121,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

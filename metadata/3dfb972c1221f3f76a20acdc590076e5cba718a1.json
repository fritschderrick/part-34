ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCausing A SceneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ displays a band which has purified its sacred mission to carry your ass into a world where music is first and foremost a party ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ not psychoanalysis. With both feet firmly entrenched in the American tradition of melodic punk, pop and metal, Her Bright Skies have developed a way to lift themselves out of small town boredom all the while creating their own niche: energetic rock conveyed with a touch of that indefinable, Nordic sound. The cockiness and the musical language is American, but the accent is perfectly Swedish.\n\n\nIf You Like It, BUY IT!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dfb972c1221f3f76a20acdc590076e5cba718a1","amp;dn":"Her_Bright_Skies-Causing_A_Scene-2010-hVa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dfb972c1221f3f76a20acdc590076e5cba718a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,251,151,44,18,33,243,247,106,32,172,220,89,0,118,229,203,167,24,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

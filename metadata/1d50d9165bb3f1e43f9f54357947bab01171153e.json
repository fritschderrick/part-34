I tried to keep the best \nvideo and audio quality with the smallest file size possible.\n\nI welcome any comments and sudgestions.\n\nMy torrent provides you downloads of up to 2MBPS, if your having trouble downloading any video due to slow speeds on anothe torrent, send me a request and I'll downloaded and put it on my torrent so everyone can enjoy the high speeds.\n\nI've noticed ever since I started to use PirateBay the number of seeders vs. leechers and it's just down right pathetic. This is why I decided to register and start to upload from my personal collection. One person can make a difference, imagine if everyone left their computers running at night while you sleep.\n\nThank you and please seed so others can enjoy.\n\n((PITBULL))\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d50d9165bb3f1e43f9f54357947bab01171153e","amp;dn":"World+War+Z+%282013%29.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d50d9165bb3f1e43f9f54357947bab01171153e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,80,217,22,91,179,241,228,63,159,84,53,121,71,186,176,17,113,21,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

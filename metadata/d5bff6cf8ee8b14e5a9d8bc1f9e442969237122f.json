Commander Christopher McGinn, a Navy flight surgeon selected by NASA to serve on two space missions. But, upon her discharge from the armed forces, Chris McGinn would set out upon a different missionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦from which she was never to return.\n\nNow Dr. Christine McGinn is able to tell her own amazing story, (picked up by the media on both MSNBC and the Oprah Winfrey show) and provide an entrance into a complex and dramatic world that is &quot;TRANS.&quot;\n\nSome of the characters featured in TRANS include:\n\nDanann, a 7 year old MTF (male to female) who knew who she was at 2 years old and has spent the rest of her short life making believers out of her parents and the rest of her world.\nCris, who only recently came to the realization that he is transgendered in a college classroom.\nPam and Erica, who had never met, but had been living the same lie for over 50 years. Now they are about to undergo surgery and begin new lives in their mid 50s.\nFinally we glimpse a moment from San Francisco's Transgender Day of Remembrance and witness a community under siege.\nThese are the stories of boys and girls, men and womanÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and all the shades in between. Stories of extraordinary people who face fear, discrimination, ignorance and violence in the hopes they might one day be able to liveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ordinary lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5bff6cf8ee8b14e5a9d8bc1f9e442969237122f","amp;dn":"Trans+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5bff6cf8ee8b14e5a9d8bc1f9e442969237122f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,191,246,207,142,232,177,78,90,157,139,193,249,228,66,150,146,55,18,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

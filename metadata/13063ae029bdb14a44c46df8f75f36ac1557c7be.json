The easy answer is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œuse statisticsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½70 million sold,\n250,000 downloadable programs on the iPhone A pp Store, 5 billion\ndownloadsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Trouble is, those statistics get stale almost before youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve\nfinished typing them.\nMaybe itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s better to talk about the aftermath. How since the iPhone came\nalong, cell carriers (AT&amp;T, V erizon, and so on) have opened up the calcified, conservative way they used to consider new cellphone designs. How every phone and its brother now have a touchscreen. How BlackBerry, Palm Pre, Google (Android) phones, and even Windows Mobile phones all have their own app stores. How, in essence, everybody wants to be the iPhone.\nThe thing is, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll never quite catch up, because A pple is always moving,\ntoo. I n June 2010, for example, it introduced the fourth iPhone model,\nthe iPhone 4. I tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s slimmer, narrower, faster, cooler-looking. I t also has a few\nnew features, including a screen with better contrast and four times the\nsharpness, a better camera (with a flash), a second camera on the front for\nmaking free video calls, a longer-life battery, and so on.\nMore importantly, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a new, free version of the iPhoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s software,\ncalled iOS 4. (Why not ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œiPhone O SÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ anymore? Because the same operating\nsystem runs on the iPad and the iPod Touch. I tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not just for iPhones\nanymore.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13063ae029bdb14a44c46df8f75f36ac1557c7be","amp;dn":"iPhone+The+Missing+Manual%2C+4th+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13063ae029bdb14a44c46df8f75f36ac1557c7be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,6,58,224,41,189,177,74,68,196,109,248,247,95,54,172,21,87,199,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

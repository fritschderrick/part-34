At the cutting edge of technology and human ingenuity they are a tale of record breaking performers and spectacular failures. Underneath the cloak of secrecy they are tales of promise and at times heartbreaking when an aircraft falls victim to circumstances or is just plain ahead of its time.\nThe readers may be well acquainted with X-1,X-15,X-31,X-33 and other American planes but what about Soviet x-planes-the tank carrying glider An-40KT or the F-16 lookalike Ye-8 or the aircraft carrying Vakhmistrov Zveno.\nThis book written by Yefim Gordon (who else) and Bill Gunston is the first to collect stories of the most important Soviet aircraft, including experimental machines from the early 1900s through to the latest Russian prototypes of today. About 150 types are described, each with data and many with extensive drawings.\n\n\nPublication Date: May 7, 2001\n                  192 pages   ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0162e0312bfc23e0565899bbf3834ca724e23d8","amp;dn":"Soviet+X-Planes.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0162e0312bfc23e0565899bbf3834ca724e23d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,22,46,3,18,191,194,62,5,101,137,155,191,56,52,202,114,78,35,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The band comprised of Dan Boeckner (later in wolf parade &amp; handsome furs) who played guitar and sang, Johnny Pollard (aka Atlas Strategic), who played the organ, synthesizer, saxophone, and sang backing vocals, Steve Simard, who played the drums, and Brooklyn Cannon, who played guitar and sang backing vocals.\nTheir first album, (the only official release) Rapture, Ye Minions! was released on Global Symphonic Records in 2000. While touring, the band recorded a second session and put out the 8-song &quot;Tour EP&quot; That&amp;#039;s Familiar! which was only distributed at shows. They also had another unofficial release called Here We Come that included the songs from That&amp;#039;s Familiar! and three more including a new version of &quot;Bad Robots&quot; from Rapture, Ye Minions!\n\nToday, Dan Boeckner continues his indie rock career by co-fronting the Canadian band Wolf Parade, and also has a side project call the Handsome Furs. Both of these bands are currently signed to Sub Pop Records. Brooklyn Cannon is now in a band based in Montreal called Total Bummer. Johnny Pollard continued to play with Dave Wenger in Daddy&amp;#039;s Hands until Dave&amp;#039;s death in November 2006. Johnny is currently planning on starting a band called The Lords Of Discipline.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://atlas.nonstuff.com/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://atlas.nonstuff.com/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy other torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/kras77&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/kras77&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86211cba21bedb2ed7e717bf682401eb4fedfe8b","amp;dn":"Atlas+Strategic+-+Rapture%2C+Ye+Minions%21%2FThat%5C%27s+Familiar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86211cba21bedb2ed7e717bf682401eb4fedfe8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,33,28,186,33,190,219,46,215,231,23,191,104,36,1,235,79,237,254,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

With his backing group The Shadows, Richard, originally positioned as a rebellious rock and roll singer in the Elvis Presley style, dominated the British popular music scene in the pre-Beatles period of the late 1950s and early 1960s. His 1958 hit single &quot;Move It&quot; is often described as Britain's first authentic rock and roll\nsong, and John Lennon once claimed that &quot;before Cliff and the Shadows, there had been nothing worth listening to in British music.&quot; A conversion to Christianity and subsequent softening of his music later led to a more middle of the road pop image, sometimes venturing into gospel. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Richard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Richard&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Shadows are a British pop group with a total of 69 UK hit charted singles: 35 as 'The Shadows' plus 34 as 'Cliff Richard and The Shadows', from the 1950s to the 2000s. The Shadows were also very successful in the British EP charts that were compiled by several different publications during the 1960s based on sales statistics from a limited number of retailers around the country. Typically The Shadows and Cliff Richard &amp; The Shadows each had 4 No.1 selling EPs. According to British Hit Singles &amp; Albums (19th edition), The Shadows are the third most successful UK charted hit-singles act, behind Elvis Presley and Cliff Richard. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadows&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadows&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTag-info created with Winamp auto-tag, liner notes and AMG.

His work had a profound influence on some of the main intellectual currents of the last two centuries. \n\n\nClearly and thematically structured, with investigations into a host of Kierkegaard's key conceptsÃ¢â‚¬â€including Ã¢â‚¬ËœimmediacyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœsinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœdespairÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœindividualityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe crowdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â€and with references to a wide range of his works, Starting with Kierkegaard provides the reader with a balanced overview of the Danish philosopherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s project, paying as much attention to the signed Ã¢â‚¬ËœedifyingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ works as to the famous authorship of the pseudonyms.\n\n\nStarting with Kierkegaard also offers a short survey of the historical, biographical and philosophical context of KierkegaardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ideas as they started to take shape in the 1830s. The book closes with a discussion of Kierkegaard and society, and of his continuing relevance to today. Starting with Kierkegaard is the ideal introduction for anyone coming to the work of this hugely important thinker for the first time.\n\n\nIf you can afford:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Starting-Kierkegaard-Patrick-Sheil/dp/1847065813&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Starting-Kierkegaard-Patrick-Sheil/dp/1847065813&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5b6f2cb2223aa6835423f911b5112d34638c1ee","amp;dn":"Starting+with+SOREN+KIERKEGAARD+-+-HQ+-+PDF.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5b6f2cb2223aa6835423f911b5112d34638c1ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,182,242,203,34,35,170,104,53,66,63,145,27,81,18,211,70,56,193,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

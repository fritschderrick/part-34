Jody first hit the charts in 1965 with &quot;Queen of the House,&quot; her answer song to Roger Miller's &quot;King of the Road,&quot; but in 1970 she signed to Epic and, under the guidance of Nashville legend Billy Sherrill, notched a string of chart hits throughout the decade, all 25 of which appear on this 69-minute collection. Most of these songs have never appeared on CD before, and they come with notes featuring quotes from Jody herself as well as photos from her private collection. Pure country ear (and eye) candy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75bd53efb6dded90d9d59c48b6035ef980e55fb2","amp;dn":"Jody+Miller+-+Complete+Epic+Hits+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75bd53efb6dded90d9d59c48b6035ef980e55fb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,189,83,239,182,221,237,144,217,213,156,72,182,3,94,249,128,229,95,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

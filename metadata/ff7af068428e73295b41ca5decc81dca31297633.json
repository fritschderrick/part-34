If you're adding the torrent via magnet link, you can deselect any undesired file in the list of files once the torrent has begun downloading.\n========================================================\n\n \n'The Finely Woven Thread' You've seen Black Widow as an Avenger and even an Agent of Shield. But on her own time she searches for atonement for her past as a KGB assassin-in ways of which those teams just wouldn't approve. From the darkest corners of the Marvel Universe, Nathan Edmonson (Who is Jake Ellis?) and Phil Noto (Thunderbolts, X-23) bring you a new ongoing series as gorgeous and mysterious as Nastasha Romanov herself!\n\n\nThanks goes to Tarutaru and theProletariat for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff7af068428e73295b41ca5decc81dca31297633","amp;dn":"Black+Widow+01-02+%282014%29+%281440%2B2048px-HD%29+%28TaruTariat-Novus%29+%5BNV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff7af068428e73295b41ca5decc81dca31297633","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,122,240,104,66,142,115,41,91,65,202,93,236,200,29,202,49,41,118,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

This may well be Man's last struggle for real freedom. The window of opportunity is closing fast. The future of mankind may hang in the balance.\n\nClinton Randolph's high IQ helped him rise from nowhere to become the wealthiest individual in the world.  As idealistic as he was intelligent and rich, he refused to buy favors from corrupt politicians, but he succeeded in spite of government opposition. A former insider warns him that the Power Elite behind the government has targeted him for destruction. They consider him a dangerous example to others because of his fierce independence, his libertarian philosophy, and his astronomical success, achieved against all odds by simply providing the best product for the best price.\n\nHis enemies have the world's governments, with their courts and arsenals, to use against him. He has his wealth, his intellect, and his indomitable spirit, yearning for the freedom that is the birthright of every human: the freedom to control his own life and his own destiny - the freedom to be truly human. If he fights by their rules on their playing field, he is doomed. He must find another way. If he, with all his resources,  is defenseless, can there be any hope for the rest of mankind? What can he do? Read The Place to Stand and find out.\n\n1030 pages; 438,000 words\nformat: pdf\nlanguage: english","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91b0ec40bf2989a86a0d348b7ad6de53c661c112","amp;dn":"The++Place+to+Stand+ebook+epic+on+freedom.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91b0ec40bf2989a86a0d348b7ad6de53c661c112","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,176,236,64,191,41,137,168,106,13,52,139,122,214,222,83,198,97,193,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

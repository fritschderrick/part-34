DiForza was building a city within the city - a shining metropolis full of high-end retail stores, corporate headquarters, and clean, new housing. It would be free of the troubles that burdened Gotham - no crime, no homelessness, no undesirables.\nOf course, DiForza has certain obstacles in her way. To build her dream city, she will have to raze large sections of run-down GothamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inner city. And as of late, squatters have taken up residence in the buildings planned for demolition. Perhaps itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only a coincidence that many of these tenements have taken to catching fire recently.\nBut maybe her worst problem is her own security chief, the Riddler. Once, it had seemed a brilliant idea to hire a master thief to find any holes in her contractorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s security plans. But when she tires of his eccentricities and turns on him, she finds this prankster can be a terrible enemy.\n\nWritten by Gerard Jones and co-plotted and illustrated by Mark Badger.  \n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c51d5ced031db4f691f21fadc1cc020f46f74c3","amp;dn":"Batman+-+Run%2C+Riddler%2C+Run","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c51d5ced031db4f691f21fadc1cc020f46f74c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,81,213,206,208,49,219,79,105,31,33,250,220,28,192,32,244,111,116,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

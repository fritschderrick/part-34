Someone has been selling the real deals and replacing them with skilled forgeries.\nUnfortunately, Grace and Bennett have to fly home the next day, so thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no time to investigate. But their troubles are hardly over. On the plane, Grace catches a woman trying to poison Bennett. The woman, of course, isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t talking, but by the end of the flight, there are two dead bodies. Now Grace has to wing it to find a mile-high murdererÃ¢â‚¬â€especially since she suspects Bennett is still in dangerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nGenre: Cozy Mystery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3ded27bf5094b588c762f37d21fca54f2fbf411","amp;dn":"Grace+Takes+Off+-+Julie+Hyzy.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3ded27bf5094b588c762f37d21fca54f2fbf411","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,222,210,123,245,9,75,88,140,118,47,55,210,31,202,84,242,251,244,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

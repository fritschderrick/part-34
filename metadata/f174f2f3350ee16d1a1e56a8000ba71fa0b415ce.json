Unlike the rest of the ocean of literature on individual chips, Microcontrollers in Practice supplieS side-by-side comparisons and an overview that treats the systems as resources available for implementation. Packed with hundred of practical examples and exercises to foster mastery of concepts and details, the guide also includes several extended projects. By treating the less expensive 8-bit and RISC microcontrollers, this information-dense manual equips students and home-experimenters with the know-how to put these devices into operation.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://images.springer.com/sgw/books/medium/9783540253013.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://images.springer.com/sgw/books/medium/9783540253013.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f174f2f3350ee16d1a1e56a8000ba71fa0b415ce","amp;dn":"Microcontrollers+in+Practice+prabhu_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f174f2f3350ee16d1a1e56a8000ba71fa0b415ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,116,242,243,53,14,225,109,26,30,86,168,0,11,167,31,160,180,21,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

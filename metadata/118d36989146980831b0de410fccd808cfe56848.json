After. Baby.\n\nThese three words are spoken in hushed voices over playdates and at playgrounds. But while we may whisper them to our closest girlfriends, or joke about them after one too many beers with the guys, when it comes to talking with our partners about what's really going on (or not going on, as the case may be) in our child-proofed bedrooms, more and more of us find ourselves tongue-tied and tiptoeing. Are you part of the &quot;sleepless, sexless&quot; club?\n\nYou just might be, if\n\nYou'd rather just go to bed than go to bed with your partner.\nThe mind-blowing sex you once had now just blows.\nThe TV is turned on more than you are.\nA playdate sounds better to you than yet another bad date night.\nThe baby gets more kisses and cuddles than you do.\nYou're beaten down from always having to initiate sex.\nForeplay has become chore-play.\n&quot;Let's get it on&quot; are now fighting words.\n\n\nFile Format: PDF\nPaperback: 272 pages\nPublisher: William Morrow Paperbacks; Original edition (January 27, 2009)\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:118d36989146980831b0de410fccd808cfe56848","amp;dn":"Ian+Kerner+-+Love+in+the+Time+of+Colic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"118d36989146980831b0de410fccd808cfe56848","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,141,54,152,145,70,152,8,49,176,222,65,15,204,216,8,207,229,104,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

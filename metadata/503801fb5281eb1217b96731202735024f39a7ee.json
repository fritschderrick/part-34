Between bed hopping and libidinous musings, intrepid secret agents Major Richard Caniday (who's really not a major) and Eric Fulmar, members of the fledging OSS, aim to smuggle out of Germany the scientist whose knowledge of metallurgy holds the key to the Third Reich's development of jet engines. The professor has a lovely daughter, of course, who is being sexually used by the sleazy Nazis; she is also used by double agents in the German high command as a tool to help undermine Hitler's mad schemes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:503801fb5281eb1217b96731202735024f39a7ee","amp;dn":"Griffin%2C+WEB+-+Men+at+war+3-The+soldier+spies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"503801fb5281eb1217b96731202735024f39a7ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,56,1,251,82,129,235,18,23,185,103,49,32,39,53,2,79,57,167,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

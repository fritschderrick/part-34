At last week's Tribal Council, ousted Altaaf took revenge by emptying his bag of rice in the fire, but it's not only the lack of food in their bellies that's leading to desperate measures. Also, this week, Captains Mark Fish and Corne Krige will also be duelling for the Salvation Cup for the last time. The outcome of this duel is extremely important for Sivu and Buhle, who know that they should use the winning Captain's right to annul one vote. They also realise that playing their secret Hidden Immunity Idol at the wrong time could be disastrous.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 04-May-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:282b1e6ac8effdd53d5fce567fb721f65fde7473","amp;dn":"Survivor.South.Africa.S05E16.PDTV.x264-RiCH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"282b1e6ac8effdd53d5fce567fb721f65fde7473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,43,30,106,200,239,253,213,61,95,206,86,127,183,33,246,95,222,116,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

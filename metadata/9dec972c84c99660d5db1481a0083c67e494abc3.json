Above all, John Adams is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dec972c84c99660d5db1481a0083c67e494abc3","amp;dn":"John+Adams+by+David+McCullough","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dec972c84c99660d5db1481a0083c67e494abc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,236,151,44,132,201,150,96,213,219,20,129,160,8,60,103,228,148,171,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

By the early 1980s, 38 Special shifted to a more accessible arena rock style without abandoning its southern rock roots. This shift helped to usher in a string of successful albums and singles.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthology 2001\n\n\n\nTracks:  \n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1. Rockin' Into The Night\n\n2. Stone Cold Believer\n\n3.

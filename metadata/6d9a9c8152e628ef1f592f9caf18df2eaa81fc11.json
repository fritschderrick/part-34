(1990)\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter first finding acclaim as a member of the Steve Miller Band, singer/songwriter Boz Scaggs went on to enjoy considerable solo success in the 1970s. Born William Royce Scaggs in Ohio on June 8, 1944, he was raised in Oklahoma and Texas, and while attending prep school in Dallas met guitarist Steve Miller. Scaggs joined Miller's group the Marksmen as a vocalist in 1959, and the pair later attended the University of Wisconsin together, where they played in blues bands like the Ardells and the Fabulous Knight Trains. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.90% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nLabel:\t\t\tColumbia\nCatalogue:\t\tCK 36841\nOriginal Release:       1980\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Lowdown\n02.You Make It So Hard (To Say No)\n03.Miss Sun\n04.Lido Shuffle\n05.We're All Alone\n06.Breakdown Dead Ahead\n07.Look What You've Done To Me\n08.Jojo\n09.Dinah Flo\n10.You Can Have Me Anytime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d9a9c8152e628ef1f592f9caf18df2eaa81fc11","amp;dn":"Boz+Scaggs+-+Hits%21+%281990%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d9a9c8152e628ef1f592f9caf18df2eaa81fc11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,154,156,129,82,230,40,239,31,89,47,156,175,24,223,46,170,129,252,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

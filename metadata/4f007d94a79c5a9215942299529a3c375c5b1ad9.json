It serves as a ripping AC/DC retrospective, tearing through such classics as &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; and &quot;For Those About to Rock,&quot; adding the pounding title track to the band's canon, and rescuing overlooked songs like &quot;Sink the Pink&quot; from otherwise mediocre albums. It's not a perfect retrospective -- there's no &quot;Back in Black,&quot; &quot;Highway to Hell,&quot; or &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot; -- but what is here is terrific. \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Who made who [03:27] \n 02.You shook me all night long [03:31] \n 03.D.

The second: a brutal race of massive predators, spread thick and still growing across the dominant landmassÃ¢â‚¬â€destined to breed and eat their way to extinction within a few centuries.\n\nAfter eight years of observation, disaster strikes the orbiting station and the remaining crew are ejected not to the safety of the city, but to the other side of the planet, deep inside a land no human could possibly survive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21cd6f97dd80290941dac6f58bb6da0768f81120","amp;dn":"Exigency+by+Michael+Siemsen+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21cd6f97dd80290941dac6f58bb6da0768f81120","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,205,111,151,221,128,41,9,65,218,198,245,139,182,218,7,104,248,17,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

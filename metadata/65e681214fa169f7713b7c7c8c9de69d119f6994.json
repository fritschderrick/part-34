A marked departure from their debut, the album is driven less by breakbeats and samples and more by organic string elements and traditional song structures.\n\nThe single &quot;Club Montepulciano&quot; was a hit in native Belgium and a minor college hit in the U.S., while &quot;Renaissance Affair&quot; was featured in the North American commercial campaign for the new Volkswagen Vapor Beetle. &quot;This Strange Effect&quot; and &quot;Eden&quot; were both featured in American cell phone commercials-- &quot;This Strange Effect&quot; for the Motorola SLVR, and most recently in 2006, &quot;Eden&quot; for the Cingular 8525. &quot;Eden&quot; was also used in the 1998 slasher film &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.&quot;At the time of their release, both songs were also featured in two separate third season episodes of La Femme Nikita. Shortly afterward, Sarah Brightman recorded a cover of &quot;Eden&quot; on her 1998 album &quot;Eden&quot;.\n\n01 &quot;Battersea&quot; (Alex Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n02 &quot;One Way Ride&quot; (Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n03 &quot;Dictionary&quot; (Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n04 &quot;Club Montepulciano&quot; (Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41\n05 &quot;Eden&quot; (Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n06 &quot;Lung&quot; (Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:44\n07 &quot;Electro Shock Faders&quot; (Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07\n08 &quot;Out of Tune&quot; (Frank DuchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n09 &quot;This Strange Effect&quot; (Ray Davies) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n10 &quot;Renaissance Affair&quot; (Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n11 &quot;Tuna&quot; (Kyoko Baertsoen, Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48\n12 &quot;Magenta&quot; (Callier) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:51\n\nBonus tracks:\n\n13 &quot;Neon&quot; (hidden track) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06 - (Japan bonus track)\n14.

It has been suggested they recorded the vocal melody several times in different keys and tempos into a sampler, then used the keyboard to transpose each one back independently to the original key, then pasted it, or spliced tape together, syllable by syllable.  Another possibility is that they used the model H910 Eventide Harmonizer, a time delay audio processor with pitch-shifting ability.\n\nSome tracks also featured the gizmo, which was a mechanical device invented by Godley, Creme, and John McConnell (professor of physics at the University of Manchester) to give a guitar a bowed effect like a violin. The device used keys which, when pressed, allowed rotating wheels to touch the guitar strings.\n\n\nAll tracks composed by Kevin Godley and Lol Creme\n\n   1. &quot;An Englishman in New York&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:37\n   2. &quot;Random Brainwave&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:38\n   3. &quot;I Pity Inanimate Objects&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:24\n   4. &quot;Freeze Frame&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47\n   5. &quot;Clues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:24\n   6. &quot;Brazilia (Wish You Were Here)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:11\n   7. &quot;Mugshots&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n   8. &quot;Get Well Soon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:38\n\n* Kevin Godley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, drums, percussion\n* Lol Creme ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, guitars, bass, xylophone, vibes, gizmo, bass pedals, acoustic guitars, piano, percussion, harmonica, moog, electric piano\n* Phil Manzanera ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ electric and acoutic guitar\n* Paul McCartney ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals\n\nThat's right...

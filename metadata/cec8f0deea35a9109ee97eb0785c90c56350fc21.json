The group was formed in 1978, with two members, Adi Newton and Steven &quot;Judd&quot; Turner. Along with contemporaries Heaven 17, Clock DVA's name was inspired by the Russian-influenced Nadsat of Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange; &quot;dva&quot; is the Russian word for &quot;two&quot;. Adi had previously worked with members of Cabaret Voltaire in a collective called The Studs and with Ian Craig Marsh and Martyn Ware in a band called The Future. Ian and Martyn went on to found The Human League.\n\nHistory\nThe group was originally known for making a form of experimental electronic music involving treated tape loops and synthesisers. Clock DVA became associated with industrial music with the 1980 release of their album White Souls in Black Suits on Throbbing Gristle's Industrial Records. The album Thirst, released on Fetish Records, followed in 1981 to a favourable critical reaction, knocking Adam and the Ants' Dirk Wears White Sox from the top of the NME Indie Charts, by which time the band had combined musique concrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨te techniques with standard rock instrumentation. The band split up in 1981, with the non original members of the band going on to form The Box.\n\nIn 1983, Newton formed a new version of the band. First releasing the single &quot;High Holy Disco Mass&quot; on the major label Polydor Records under the name DVA, the band then released the album Advantage (with several singles) under the name Clock DVA. After a European tour, however, the band split acrimoniously.\n\nAfter the 1983 breakup of Clock DVA, Adi Newton formed The Anti-Group or T.A.G.C..They released several albums continuing in a similar vein to the early Clock DVA, yet more experimental.\n\nIn 1987, Adi Newton reactivated DVA and invited Dean Dennis and Paul Browse back into the fold to aid Newton's use of computer aided sampling techniques which he had been developing in the Anti Group. The album Buried Dreams, an electronic album which received critical acclaim as a pioneering work. Browse left the group in 1989 and was replaced by R E Baker. The album Man-Amplified was the next album to be released, an exploration of cybernetics. Digital Soundtracks, an instrumental album, was the next release. Following Dennis's departure, Newton and Baker produced the album Sign.\n\nAdi Newton has now reactivated DVA along with his creative partner Jane Radion Newton in 2008.\n\n\nT.A.G.C. or The Anti-Group (Company/Collective)\n\n\nThe Anti-Group Company, or T.A.G.C. are a side project of Clock DVA. Formed in the early 1980s by Adi Newton (although the idea existed as early as 1978), T.A.G.C. (originally The Anti-Group) was conceived as an open-membership experimental multimedia collective, focused on audio, visual, and textual research and production, as well as performance art and installations.\n\nT.A.G.C. audio recordings are released on Newton's Anterior Research Recordings label. The theoretical underpinnings of these recordings, which are often primarily psychoacoustic experiments or carefully-constructed aural rituals, are made explicit in the lengthy liner notes which accompany most releases.\n\nThe acronym T.A.G.C. is also intended to represent the four nucleotides that make up DNA (thymine, adenine, guanine and cytosine).\n\nThe original idea for the Anti Group was devised by Adi Newton &amp; S.J. Turner as early as 1978, with the intention of the formation of a multi-dimensional research &amp; development project active in many related areas. Research and development of sound/film/video/performance and the documentation of each project was the fundamental &quot;Modus Operandi&quot;. Underlining this basic idea lays the deeper philosophical and theoretical; The first non theoretical action devised by TAG was the Film &quot;The delivery&quot;, a 16mm triptych projection and soundtrack, and the Anti theatre performance &quot;The Discussion&quot; designed for five tape recorders and multi-video projection systems. These two works were first presented at the &quot;De Doelen&quot; center in Rotterdam on Sat. Sep 22nd, 1985. &quot;The delivery&quot; has been exhibited at the &quot;2nd Atonal festival&quot; in &quot;The Ballhaus Tiergarten&quot; Berlin, Feb 18th 1985 where the soundtrack was recorded on a mobile 24 track system. This document was released as the recording &quot;The delivery&quot; on Atonal Records. After these initial performances TAG concentrated on Audio development. it was during this period 1985-1987 that the above recordings were realized along with the highly acclaimed Ambisonic Album &quot;Digitaria&quot; which is a Technological and Ethnological work based on the ideas of the Sabean cults of ancient Khem and the Dogon tribe of Mali. Having worked through these areas, it became the next logical step to move into the application of Psychophysics developing the use of frequencies and Psychoacoustics with computer aided technology. Performance of these ideas took place at the 3rd Atonal Festival at &quot;TU Mensa&quot; Berlin on Dec 13th 1986 and &quot;SO 36&quot; Berlin on Feb 14th 1987 and at the &quot;Museum of Contemporary Art&quot; Prato, Italy on Sept 23rd 1988. it was at this time also that TAG displayed their first Meontological visual experiment &quot;Burning Water&quot;. The recordings utilized in these performances were released as part of a series of recordings entitled Meontological Research Recordings 1+2. Currently, &quot;Burning Water&quot; has been finalized for released and will be available on CD/Video formats. TAG performances were held at the Electro-Acoustic Music Academy Stockholm, Aug 23rd 1990 and at the ARS Electronica symposium on Virtual Reality held in Linz Sep 8th 1990 Austria. Currently in preparation are Meontological Research Recordings 3+4. Recording 3 explores the central ideas expressed in the Coulier Noire and recording 4 centers around the current research project into the development of methods and techniques to aid expanded consciousness in collaboration with R.E.S.T., SpaceTimeTanks and Relaxation Center Chicago, America. In the TAGC projects, The Anti Group have recently started to return to the Arena after a number of years researching and experimenting with different medias and theoretical concepts, currently working on a number of new releases, and have recently contributed an abridged research document and sound piece for the next issue of Antibodies. Currently preparing for live performance and installation events as well as a series of artifacts for release during 2009\n\n\n\n\n\nThis torrent contains the following releases:\n\n\nClockDVA release their first official album WHITE SOULS IN BLACK SUITS in 1980 via an invitation from Throbbing Gristle to be released on their Industrial Records label as a cassette release only. The album itself is a raw pre-amble prior to the Formation of Thirst. Taken from fifteen hours of improvisational sessions a five member version of DVA recorded the sessions via a mobile recording unit.The album was mixed and produced at Caberet Voltaires Western Works studio. The album includes a tape chance montage sequence in collaboration with Chris Watson. Richard H Kirk and Stephen Mallider engineered and co-produced in collaboration with DVA.\n\n1) WHITE SOULS IN BLACK SUITS\nContempo CONTEDISC 157 [CD][ITAL](1992 re-release)\n\n1. Consent (5:05)\n2.

It was received with unilateral critical acclaim and projected Clockdva into a position as one of the cutting edge groups to emerge from the Industrial New Wave movement. Among the many outstanding reviews the one by Paul Morley in the NME stands out. &quot;'Thirst' is the first brilliant LP of 1981 and one of the great records of the '80s&quot;.\n\n2) THIRST\nContempo CONTEDISC 192[CD][ITAL] (1992 re-release)\n\nPersonnel 1981:\nAdi Newton\nSteven &quot;Judd&quot; Turner\nCharlie Collins\nRoger Quail\nPaul Widger\n\n1.

It was shortly after the recording of the titles &quot;City of Night&quot;, &quot;Sister&quot;, &quot;Someday&quot; and &quot;Sequential&quot; at John Foxx's studio The Garden and the John Peel session that DVA began a major European Tour.\n\nPersonnel\nAdi Newton\nPaul Browse\nDean Dennis\nJohn Valentine Carruthers\nNick Sanderson\n\n3) ADVANTAGE\nContempo CON 191[CD][ITAL] (1992 re-release)\n\n1.

The band line up now consists of three members of the Advantage era line up: Paul Browse, Dean Dennis, and Adi Newton.\nLikened to Kraftwerk's darker half, the band promotes a cyberpunk &quot;man + machine&quot; philosophy. &quot;ClockDVA have picked up where Kraftwerk left off&quot; --- Alternative Press\n\n\n4) THE ACT\n01708-10 [CD]\n\n1.

Also that same year, a live album entitled TRANSITIONAL VOICES was released and Robert E. Baker became a fully fledged member of Clock DVA . This recording caused unresolvable differences between Adi and the issuing record label, Interfisch Records in Germany. Adi cancelled the contract with Interfisch and severed all connections. This dispute effected U.S. record label Wax Trax records who where to be re-releasing the ClockDVA back catalog via a licensing agreement through Interfisch. All Wax Trax released in the end was the album BURIED DREAMS and a number of singles, and a catalog number for the 'un-re-issued' ADVANTAGE album. Soon after that, the band signed with Contempo Records in Italy. A company very interested in promoting and contributing to the advancement of ClockDVA.\n\n7) SOUND MIRROR\nWAXCD 9105 [CD][US]\n\n1.

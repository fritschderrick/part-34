Japanese soundtrack is in 5.1 DTS. \n\nSubtitles: English, Traditional Chinese, &amp; Simplified Chinese\n\n\nHighly recommended to anyone interested in World War 2 films from a non-Hollywood/Western perspective.  \n\nTrailers can be found on youtube; seach for &quot;For Those We Love&quot;.\n\n\nThis is my first upload to TPB (hopefully everythin was done right). I&amp;#039;ve ripped it to be region-free. It looks excellent upscaled via my PS3. Enjoy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f115f09179480f6ebc8b095e7a3f8b3f422a356e","amp;dn":"For+Those+We+Love+%28+2007+%29+DVD+Rip%3B+Japanese%3B+English+Subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f115f09179480f6ebc8b095e7a3f8b3f422a356e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,21,240,145,121,72,15,110,188,139,9,94,122,63,139,63,66,42,53,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The struggle between the supporters and opponents of the Spanish Second Republic raged between 1936 and 1939. During the war, new names were written large in world history; names such as the International Brigade and the Nationalist General Franco, who led his side to ultimate victory. Featuring fascinating archive film and location footage, plus dramatized Ã¢â‚¬Å“eyewitnessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ accounts, the DVD provides an intriguing account of a dark and divided period of Spanish history. This program also features photographs and interviews with surviving members of the International Brigade. Expert interpretation and analysis provides historical and political background to the war.\n\nChapters: \n1. Introduction \n2. A State of Anarchy \n3. Madrid \n4. Effects of the War \n5.

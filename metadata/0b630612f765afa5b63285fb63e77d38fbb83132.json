On the surface, a young heir-apparent, Dilip (Dev Anand) is hopelessly in love with an aspiring film actor,\nNayantara (Kaushalya) who together with her scheming mother(Sunalini Devi), a struggling director (Randhir) and assistant actually wants him to finance her launching pad.\nThe stumbling block is Dilip's ailing grandfather, Rai Saheb (Bipin Gupta) who is dead against the alliance and constantly warning him to break away from the actress that will otherwise only bring shame to the family.\nAlthough Dilip keeps assuring him that he has severed all ties, and is, in fact, dating a homely girl from a middle class family, he is actually besotted with the actress who is simultaneously in an unholy alliance with big star Ashok Kumar (Ashok Kumar).\nPersuaded by Rai Sahib, Dilip hires the services of Kiran (Meena Kumari) as his new love interest.\nAs Kiran gets more and more comfortable as the housekeeper, Dilip gets caught in the whirlpool of his own creation, drowned in his infatuation with Nayantara and admiration for Kiran.\nMummy, the director and Nayantara conspire and photograph Dilip in intimate moments with the latter, start blackmailing and threaten to take them to court.\nAfter some melodramatic scenes, actor Ashok Kumar brings in a dramatic end to the drama, teasingly telling the director and the heroine, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Kaise raha yeh twist climax mein ? (How was this twist in the climax),Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a dialogue the actor repeatedly deploys in the film.\nIt was unusual, and first in many ways: this is the only film in which Anand and Kishore Kumar acted together; this was both Ashok Kumar and Meena Kumari's outing with Dev; the only one in the evergreen hero's long and distinguished career where he is not seen singing a solo or a duet. Also the dialogue by famous Urdu writer, Krishan Chandar: Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Samajhdar log dil se nahin dimag se mohabbat karte hai (The wise use their head not heart to be in love),Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ actor Ashok Kumar tells a besotted Dilip; Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mohabbat usi ka naam hai jo qurbaniyan na de (Love is that which does not give sacrifices)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nMANNA DEY \nManna Dey took over as music director after the untimely death of the original composer Khemchand Prakash.\nFive of the nine songs penned by Bharat Vyas and set to music by Manna Dey Ã¢â‚¬â€ Lata numbers (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Armanon ki nagri ujad gayiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kyon aakhiyan bhar aayiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) or Geeta Dutt's Ã¢â‚¬Å“Raat mere meetha meethaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Asha Bhosle's Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thi jinse pal bhar ki pehchan Ã¢â‚¬â€ nor Khemchand Prakash's compositions with Lata, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mere chhote se dil ko tod chaleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Kishore Kumar, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jab miyan biwin raaziÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ contributed to the success of the film. The highlight song was Ã¢â‚¬Å“Koi jal jal mereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Kishore also rendered the mediocre Ã¢â‚¬Å“Khali peeli kahe ko akhaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\nDirected by Phani Majumdar from his own screenplay, it had cinematography by Roque M Layton, and editing by Raghu Tipnis with choreography by Lacchu Maharaj.\nA young Meena Kumari with a sparkle in her eyes and an impish smile was quite the opposite of the accomplished tragedienne she became immortalised as.\nDev Anand looked much more comfortable, though somewhat awkward in the romantic sequences, than in his earlier outings.\nBipin Gupta was brilliant, Kaushalya just passable. Even in a side role of Rajju, Dilip's half brother gave a clear vision of his capabilities as a light, facile-footed performer, a much thinner version of his later successful star.\n\nSYNOPSIS:- Tamasha (1952)\nTamasha is a 1952 comedy movie starring DevAnand, Meena Kumari, Ashok Kumar and young Kishore Kumar. The skeletal story outline is DevAnand, a rich man, falls for Sulochana. Sulochana behind Dev's money. Dev's dadaji acts as if he is Beemar, to get Dev wedded to a gal who is rich in Indian culture etc., Dev unknown of Dadaji's act, brings Meena Kumari and pretends to be in love with her. Ashok Kumar who first gives an impression of being a stubborn rich actor, later to be realized as a kind hearted bade dilwala aadmi. Dev gets blackmailed by Sulochana, after taking few snaps of him and her together in a very comprising position on the bed. The end is happy.. all thanks to Ashok Kumar, who comes as a saviour.\nThe movie has great numbers by Lata, Asha, Kishore, Rajkumari and Geeta Dutt. Lyrics by Bharat Vyas and Music by Khem Chand Prakash, Manna Dey and S.K.Pal.\nA must watch movie for all Kishore and Dev fans. In the successive days, It will cover various comical portion of video from this movie. For now, don't miss out this scene, where Kishore Da first appears in this movie. \n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate:1488 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 352x272\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.294:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate:108kb/s VBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:Hindi\nRunTime  1:00:49\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by:Trinidad  \nDuration: 2:10:24 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b630612f765afa5b63285fb63e77d38fbb83132","amp;dn":"Tamasha+%281952%29+Xvid+2cd_No+Subs+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b630612f765afa5b63285fb63e77d38fbb83132","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,99,6,18,247,101,175,165,182,50,133,251,99,231,125,56,251,184,49,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

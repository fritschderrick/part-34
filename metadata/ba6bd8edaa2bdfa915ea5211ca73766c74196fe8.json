Maya wants to know absolutely everything about how her parents met and fell in love. Will's story begins in 1992, as a young, starry-eyed aspiring politician who moves to New York from Wisconsin in order to work on the Clinton campaign. For Maya, Will relives his past as a idealistic young man learning the ins and outs of big city politics, and recounts the history of his romantic relationships with three very different women. On the campaign, Will's best buddy is Russell McCormack. They not only have similar political aspirations, they share the same type of girl problems, too. Will hopelessly attempts a &quot;PG&quot; version of his story for his daughter ad changes the names so Maya has to guess who he finally married...\n\nDirector: Adam Brooks\n\nStars:              Ryan Reynolds, Rachel Weisz and Abigail Breslin\nimdb:    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0832266/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0832266/&lt;/a&gt;     \n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/7liX3.png[/IMG]\n\nscreenshots\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/R0cDe.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/R0cDe.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/HVpWt.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/HVpWt.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/s1klb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/s1klb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n               &lt;a href=&quot; http://i.imgur.com/o0kGw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://i.imgur.com/o0kGw.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n               RECOMMENDED PLAYER TO VIEW THE MOVIES ARE KM PLAYER(i use this)  OR  VLC PLAYER\n\n                \n          MY COMPUTER IS RUNNING NON STOP TO PROVIDE THESE MOVIES SO A SIMPLE THANKS WOULD BE ENOUGH.ITS REALLY SAD THAT MANY DOWNLOAD BUT DONT EVEN RATE OR COMMENT\n\n            DONT HIT AND RUN,SEED BACK.LET OTHERS ENJOY TOO AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS FOR FREE SO ATLEAST SEED BACK    \n\n                                      \n\n\n                       SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.SHARING IS CARING\n\n                       HIGHLY RECOMMENDED \n\n                         DO COMMENT ON THE QUALITY,IT WONT TAKE MUCH OF YOUR TIME  \n                               CHECK OUT MY OTHER TORRENTS \n\n                                                   \n                                             [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/wF4BC.png[/IMG]\n\n         to visit my facebook page for requests GOOGLE SUJAIDR\n\nNOTE:due to frequent power cuts,seeding might be interrupted so patience guys and remember to rate,comment,seed AFTER DOWNLOAD and enjoy.\n\nREQUESTS ARE WELCOME AND WILL DO IT WHEN POSSIBLE\n\nafter repeated requests,still there is a lot of hit and run on my torrents.therefore download my movies while i am seeding,get it before the torrent dies\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/FkbPX.gif[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\nPRESS THE +1 TO RATE MY TORRENT AS THERE ARE MORONS WHO INTENTIONALLY NEGATIVE RATE MY TORRENTS SO PLEASE SUPPORT ME BY RATIN UP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba6bd8edaa2bdfa915ea5211ca73766c74196fe8","amp;dn":"Definitely+Maybe+2008+720p+BRRIP_sujaidr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba6bd8edaa2bdfa915ea5211ca73766c74196fe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,107,216,237,170,43,223,169,21,234,82,17,202,115,118,108,116,25,111,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

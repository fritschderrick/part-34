Victoria has a wild history of adventures involving gold mining and bush rangers. The two biggest gold nuggets in the world were both found in Victoria, and Ned Kelly and his gang have featured in many movies (even Mick Jagger portrayed Ned in 1970).\n\nToday, Victoria is a much tamer place and Melbourne is often voted to be one of the most livable cities in the world. One of the top three tourist locations in Australia can be found in Victoria - the magnificent Great Ocean Road. You can find 36 national parks in Victoria, the scenery ranges from rugged alpine forests, over ancient volcanic plains, world famous vineyards, rugged coastlines, and beautiful beaches, to hot and barren deserts. A whopping 36% of Victoria is covered in forest and 17% of it&amp;#039;s total area is protected. The scenery in Victoria keeps changing and just like in the old times, adventures are around every corner. Victoria truly is a winner, what a place to visit as a virtual pilot!\n \n\nA road network as real as it can be\n\nRoads &amp; Rivers includes all mapped roads in Victoria, this means you get thousands and thousands of roads and they all look like their real counterpart. Also included are an amazing number of dirt roads and the complete set of railways, including Melbourne &amp;#039;s extensive commuter train network.\n\nNo more simplified grey bands stretching sparingly over dull landscapes. This addon gives you the extraordinary sense of a real place, roads weaving along rugged mountains, roads following the coast and along rivers in a realistic fashion, roads simply all over the place ÃƒÂ¢?? this is Victoria&amp;#039;s true road network.\n\nAlso included are thousands of bridges; if a road crosses a river, there will be a bridge. You can follow the famous Great Ocean Road as it realistically winds its way along the magnificent coastline. You will even be able to identify the F1 Albert Park road course and the SBK Phillip Island track. Say goodbye to the poor basic set of roads in MSFS and get Victoria &amp;#039;s real transport network in Roads &amp; Rivers.\n\nRivers and Lakes stunningly beautiful\n\nYou&amp;#039;ve seen the uninspiring streams and crude lakes in MSFS. Roads &amp; Rivers is here to change all that and breathe life into Victoria&amp;#039;s water world. Watch the Yarra River wind its way through Melbourne and experience the mighty Murray River in its true beauty. Rivers won&amp;#039;t look like straight, uninspiring streams anymore, but they will wind their way through the terrain snakelike in very realistic fashion. With Roads &amp; Rivers they will simply look alive. And to complement the major rivers, we have also included the minor streams to make Victoria even more life-like.\n\n\nKeep seeding after downloading","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5956043206939c98dafcfa3b6412a355715420b","amp;dn":"FSX-FS2004+-+RBE+-+FLIGHT+SIM+eXperience+-+ROADS+AND+RIVERS+OF+V","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5956043206939c98dafcfa3b6412a355715420b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,149,96,67,32,105,57,201,141,175,207,163,182,65,42,53,87,21,66,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

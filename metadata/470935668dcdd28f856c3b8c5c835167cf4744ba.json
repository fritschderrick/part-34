Caroline is an army wife,\n                recently moved to barracks with a new baby. Her\n                husband Tom is on his first tour away, and Caroline\n                is finding it hard to adjust to life alone. She\n                receives help from old hand Maggie, who puts Caroline\n                in touch with rat catcher Sam when she finds herself\n                with a vermin problem. Caroline and Sam quickly\n                become close friends, with Sam unwittingly taking\n                Tom's place within the household. Their friendship\n                arouses suspicion among the other wives, however, and\n                Sam soon pays a terrible price. Sam and Caroline end\n                up confessing their love for one another, but they\n                are interrupted by a tragic phone call.\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:470935668dcdd28f856c3b8c5c835167cf4744ba","amp;dn":"Moving.On.S03E02.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"470935668dcdd28f856c3b8c5c835167cf4744ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,9,53,102,141,205,210,143,133,108,59,140,92,131,81,103,207,71,68,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

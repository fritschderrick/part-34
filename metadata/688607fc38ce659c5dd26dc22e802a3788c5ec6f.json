The first song with a distinctly British derivation is &quot;Willy O'Winsbury,&quot; but before long Renbourn is evoking Robert Johnson on &quot;Come on in My Kitchen.&quot; That Delta blues is followed by &quot;Country Blues,&quot; and then the original instrumental title tune. Throughout, Renbourn and his cohorts explore the various folk styles with delicacy and restraint; that's the British element coming through, and it gives an elegance to the material. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/02/10/john-renbourn-2/[/url]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:688607fc38ce659c5dd26dc22e802a3788c5ec6f","amp;dn":"John+Renbourn...Faro+Annie%281971%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"688607fc38ce659c5dd26dc22e802a3788c5ec6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,134,7,252,56,206,101,156,93,210,109,194,46,128,42,55,136,197,236,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

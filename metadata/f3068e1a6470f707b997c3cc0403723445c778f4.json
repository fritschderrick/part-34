Much of this was issued on various European albums during the '70s, always transferred off of muffled-sounding copy tapes. These 21 tracks (all but two of them off the master tapes) feature the amp-on-11 guitar work of Willie Johnson and the cave-man drumming of Willie Steele; they're loose and somewhat chaotic, with Wolf sounding utterly demonic. The real bonus on this volume is the first-time inclusion of both sides of the only known acetate of Wolf's first session at Sam Phillips' 706 Union Avenue studio from 1951. With only Johnson and Steele in support (no bass, no piano), these early versions of &quot;How Many More Years&quot; and &quot;Baby Ride with Me (Riding in the Moonlight)&quot; are Wolf at his most primitive.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 Oh Red (Take 1) (2:46)\n02 My Last Affair (Take 1) (3:05)\n03 Come Back Home (Take 1) (2:37)\n04 California Boogie (3:00)\n05 California Blues (2:58)\n06 Look-A-Here Baby (2:11)\n07 Smile At Me (2:06)\n08 My Baby Walked Off (3:01)\n09 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ Cv Wine (Cv Wine Blues) (3:08)\n10 My Troubles And Me (3:18)\n11 Chocolate Drop (2:43)\n12 Mr. Highway Man (Cadillac Daddy) (2:28)\n13 Bluebird Blues (2:50)\n14 Color And Kind (3:12)\n15 (EverybodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s) In The Mood (3:00)\n16 Dorothy Mae (Number 2) (2:39)\n17 I Got A Woman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Sweet Woman (3:29)\n18 Decoration Day Blues (3:17)\n19 (Well) ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s All Right (3:03)\n20 How Many More Years (2:51)\n21 Baby Ride With Me (RidinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ In The Moonlight) (2:56)\n\n\nThe Memphis Days: Definitive Edition, Vol. 2\nRelease Date:1990\nRecording Date: May 14, 1951 - Oct 7, 1952\n\n\nThe second volume in this series collects up all the known Memphis recordings that were either issued or originally offered to Chess. As such, it stands as a marvelous collection of Wolf's early 78s for that label. But what truly puts it over is the added bonus of a newly discovered acetate featuring several unissued versions of &quot;How Many More Years&quot; and &quot;Baby Ride With Me (Riding in the Moonlight).&quot; Much of this volume is pulled from discs, but the overall sound is good and the performances make it yet another must-have.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 Baby Ride With Me (RidinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ in the Moonlight) (2:44)\n02 How Many More Years (2:43)\n03 MoaninÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ at Midnight (2:57)\n04 HowlinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ Wolf Boogie (2:39)\n05 Wolf Is at Your Door (3:01)\n06 Mr. Highway Man (2:49)\n07 Getting Old and Grey (2:39)\n08 Worried All the Time (3:09)\n09 Saddle My Pony (Gonna Find My Baby Out In World Somewhere) (2:34)\n10 Oh, Red!

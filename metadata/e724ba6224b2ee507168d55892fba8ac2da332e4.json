Released as a single in late-1975, the song became the band's first worldwide hit. According to Jeff Lynne this song was the quickest he had ever written, in thirty minutes, originally as 'filler' for the group's Face the Music album. The song placed in the top ten on both sides of the Atlantic in early-1976. The song became a hit again in the UK in 1978 when it featured on the ELO EP. The lyric &quot;There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in&quot; is a tribute to The Beatles' song &quot;Fixing a Hole&quot;.\n(video has a semi-transparent yellow/black/white &quot;VH1 Classic Rock&quot; logo at the top right)\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_Woman_(Electric_Light_Orchestra_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_Woman_(Electric_Light_Orchestra_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eAbhgAAde&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eAbhgAAde&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG4 Video 768x576 25.00fps 6641kbps\n   Audio: AAC 48000Hz stereo stereo 165kbps\n   Duration: 00:04:13\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.

Albrecht et al. (Wiley-VCH, 2003).pdf\r\n\r\nFrom the utilization of textile waste to the high-tech product - this is how modern nonwovens can best described.\r\nWeb formation and web bonding processes have recently being enhanced. Nowadays, fibres, granulates, binder and finishing agents are used. This development entails a wider range of applications in the fields of hygiene, medicine, the garment-producing and building industries, interior design as well as further technical uses. \r\n\r\nThis book provides comprehensive information about nonwovens, from the raw material fibres via the manufacturing processes to finishing and to the ready-made product. Nonwoven characteristics and the fields of application are discussed in detail as well as the processes available to test the raw materials, the intermediate and the final products. \r\n\r\nThis book will be the standard reference on nonwovens in the years to come!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51af2e78cedf6caebea7c1da5a37d632a55622db","amp;dn":"Nonwoven+Fabrics+-+Raw+Materials%2C+Manufacture%2C+Applications%2C+Cha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51af2e78cedf6caebea7c1da5a37d632a55622db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,175,46,120,206,223,108,174,190,167,193,218,90,55,214,50,165,86,34,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

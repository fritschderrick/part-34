They are generally considered progressive rock, with jazz, punk, and Latin influences. They are known for their wild, energetic and improvised live shows, as well as their usually concept-based studio albums.&quot;\n\nAlbums -\n Studio -\n  De-Loused in the Comatorium (2003)\n  Frances the Mute (2005)\n  Amputechture (2006)\n  The Bedlam in Goliath (2008)\n EPs -\n  Tremulant (2002)\n Live -\n  Scabdates (2005)\n\nFormat -\n Most in 224k ABR MP3, Tremulant in 192k ABR\n All cleanly ID3v2 tagged\n\nGeneral notes -\nThis torrent contains all but 1 album (Live from 2003) in the current diskography for The Mars Volta.  I was unable to locate a copy of Tremulant in stores, and resorted to eMusic to locate it (hence it&amp;#039;s lower bitrate).\nThis torrent is NOT a RAR recompression of the files, just the files themselves, so it&amp;#039;s easier to pick through to download parts if you just need to fill in your collection of this excellent band.  Please, I highly encourage you to purchase these albums after reviewing, as they are excellent works and the band truly deserves your support. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c645faef3d669d664e69e3f57f130fe966370ab","amp;dn":"The+Mars+Volta+-+All+Studio+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c645faef3d669d664e69e3f57f130fe966370ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,100,95,174,243,214,105,214,100,230,158,63,87,241,48,254,150,99,112,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

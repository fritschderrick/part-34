The annual will cover space exploration from a variety of angles, looking back at past missions, reviewing those currently under way and detailing those planned for the future, and encompassing both manned and unmanned spaceflight.\n\nChapter 1 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ The Annual Review, written by Brian Harvey appears every year. It will include details of all satellite and rocket launches in the previous year and satellite recoveries, analysis of developments and emerging trends in space exploration, notes on records and main feats during the year, basic data on all launchers currently in operation, schedules of upcoming missions, anniversaries and landmarks.

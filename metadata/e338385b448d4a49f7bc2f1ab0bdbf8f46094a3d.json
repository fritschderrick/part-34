During this tour, they recorded their first DVD. They also made a string of appearances on Irish television throughout this time, including a memorable appearance with Phil Coulter and George Murphy on RTÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â° 1.\n\nAfter the tour, Jim McCann was diagnosed with throat cancer and though he fully recovered his voice was severely damaged, and he has not been able to sing since his illness. Despite this, Jim regularly acts as MC at folk gigs, notably at Dubliners reunion shows and at the 2006 'Legends of Irish Folk' shows (where he also played guitar in the finale).\n\nIn 2005 Paddy Reilly moved to the United States, and Patsy Watchorn joined the group. Watchorn made a name for himself with The Dublin City Ramblers; like Luke Kelly, he accompanies his songs on the 5 string banjo.\n\nAfter 45 years, the band still tours Europe every year, though instrumentalists Barney McKenna and John Sheahan are the only original members left in the band.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Dubliners-Road-Live-Germany/dp/B000RPBGLK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1230690065&amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Dubliners-Road-Live-Germany/dp/B000RPBGLK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1230690065&amp;sr=1-1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEditorial Reviews\nProduct Description\nFormed in 1962, The Dubliners are perhaps one of the most well known Irish Folk groups.

The scientist is sentenced to jail by the Grand Council of the Galactic Federation. The experiment is supposed to be transported to a prison asteroid, yet manages to escape Captain Gantu, who was supposed to deliver him there. With a stolen police cruiser (the red one), the destructive being races towards a little and already doomed planet: Earth. Stranded on Hawaii, experiment #626 can't actually do much harm: water all around, no big cities and two well-equipped representatives of the Galactic Federation already following close behind to catch him again. But Dr. Jookiba and the Earth expert Pleakley never could have guessed that earth girl Lilo adopts the experiment as dog.\n\nGeneral:\n\nComplete name : D:MY MOVIESLilo and Stitch DVDRip 350 MBLilo and Stitch.mkv\nFormat : Matroska\nFile size : 358 MiB\nDuration : 1h 25mn\nOverall bit rate : 587 Kbps\nMovie name : Lilo And Stitch(2002)\n\nVideo:\n\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat settings : Yes\nDuration : 1h 25mn\nNominal bit rate : 504 Kbps\nWidth : 624 pixels\nHeight : 368 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 1.696\nFrame rate : 24 fps\nLanguage : English\n\nAudio:\n\nID : 2\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile : HE-AAC / LC\nCodec ID : A_AAC\nDuration : 1h 25mn\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nTitle : English\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a3a6b55298913eca90125de88fe071293bca1cd","amp;dn":"Lilo+and+Stitch+%282002%29+DVDRip+350+MB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a3a6b55298913eca90125de88fe071293bca1cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,58,107,85,41,137,19,236,169,1,37,222,136,254,7,18,147,188,161,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Stephen Stills was at a Judy Collins session in 1968, and when she was finished, Stills reserved a studio and recorded a tape of new songs. Stills left the masters in the studio, and they were almost discarded when the facility closed in 1978. Musician Joe Colasurdo, who was rehearsing there at the time, was told by the owner that he could cart off any tapes he wanted to before they cleared the place out. After seeing Stills' names on several of the boxes, Colasurdo kept them safe until he could find a reel-to-reel machine to play them on.\n\nJoe began attempting to get the masters safely back into Stills' hands, an undertaking that took 25 years. In 2003, he was connected to Graham Nash after happening to meet a close friend of his. Nash received the tapes, passed them on to Stephen, encouraging him to release them.\n\nStills is the only musician on the album. He sings all the songs and plays acoustic guitar and dobro. Treetop Flyer is not from the 1968 sessions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b69b0b9bfebf147e32cd112fd7cfeef4f732a11","amp;dn":"Stephen+Stills+-+Just+Roll+Tape+April+26%2C+1968","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b69b0b9bfebf147e32cd112fd7cfeef4f732a11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,105,176,185,191,235,241,71,227,44,209,18,253,124,254,239,79,115,42,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

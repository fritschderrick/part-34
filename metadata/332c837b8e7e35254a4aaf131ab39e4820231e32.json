A devoted husband, proud father of four children in their twenties, and respected officer, Joe begins experiencing bouts of disorganized thinking, uncharacteristic temper outbursts, and strange, involuntary movements. He initially attributes these episodes to the stress of his job, but as these symptoms worsen, he agrees to see a neurologist and is handed a diagnosis that will change his and his familyâ€™s lives forever: Huntingtonâ€™s disease.\r\n\r\nHuntingtonâ€™s is a lethal neurodegenerative disease with no treatment and no cure. Each of Joeâ€™s four children has a 50 percent chance of inheriting their fatherâ€™s disease, and a simple blood test can reveal their genetic fate. While watching her potential future in her fatherâ€™s escalating symptoms, twenty-one-year-old daughter Katie struggles with the questions this test imposes on her young adult life. Does she want to know? What if sheâ€™s gene positive? Can she live with the constant anxiety of not knowing?\r\n\r\nAs Joeâ€™s symptoms worsen and heâ€™s eventually stripped of his badge and more, Joe struggles to maintain hope and a sense of purpose, while Katie and her siblings must find the courage to either live a life â€œat riskâ€ or learn their fate.\r\n\r\nPraised for writing that â€œexplores the resilience of the human spiritâ€ (The San Francisco Chronicle), Lisa Genova has once again delivered a novel as powerful and unforgettable as the human insights at its core.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE SEED**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:332c837b8e7e35254a4aaf131ab39e4820231e32","amp;dn":"Inside+the+O%27Briens+-+Lisa+Genova","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"332c837b8e7e35254a4aaf131ab39e4820231e32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,44,131,123,142,126,53,37,74,74,175,19,26,179,158,72,32,35,30,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

(1989)\nHDTracks, 24 bits, 192 KHz\n\nAnother typically wonderful CD reissue of Ella Fitzgerald in her prime, this set augments the original LP (which finds Ella joined by pianist Lou Levy, guitarist Herb Ellis, bassist Joe Mondragon, and drummer Stan Levey) with three previously unreleased selections from the same era (with Levey, bassist Wilfred Middlebrooks, and drummer Gus Johnson). Ella is in fine form on such numbers as &quot;A Night in Tunisia,&quot; an emotional &quot;You're My Thrill,&quot; &quot;Jersey Bounce,&quot; &quot;Clap Hands! Here Comes Charlie,&quot; and an unissued &quot;The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else).&quot; Although not reaching the heights of her live performances, this is an excellent (and somewhat underrated) set.

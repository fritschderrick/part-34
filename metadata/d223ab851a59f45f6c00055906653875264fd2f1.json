Filled with remorse, Danny is determined to live out his days by a code of non-violence and maneuvers deftly within a ruthless prison system. \n\nBut when Renee Gilmore, the woman he loves, receives a box containing a bloody finger and draconian demands from a mysterious enemy on the outside, Danny must find a way to escape.\n\nThey are both drawn into a terrifying game of life and death. If Renee fails, the priest will die; if Danny fails, Renee will die. And the body count will not stop at two.\n\nTHE SANCTUARY is Ted Dekker at his best, a powerful thriller that relentlessly plumbs the depths of punishment and rehabilitation, both in a flawed corrections system and in the human heart.\n\nFull ePub and Mobi Retail.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d223ab851a59f45f6c00055906653875264fd2f1","amp;dn":"The+Sanctuary+by+Ted+Dekker+%28ePub%2C+Mobi+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d223ab851a59f45f6c00055906653875264fd2f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,35,171,133,26,89,244,95,108,0,5,89,6,101,56,117,38,79,210,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

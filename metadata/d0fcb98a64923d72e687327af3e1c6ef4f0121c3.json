Also included is the artwork and ooklet scans, the Artwork foler for them all is pretty big (127 MB) so sorry about that, bu it's all high quality :3.\n\nAll tracks have a bitrate of 320.\n\nOne other note, will someone please explain why so many people hate this album just because Jon Anersn isn't on it? I mean, this album is petty good, David's vocals are amazing, even Anderson said so. Same goes for the 'Drama' album, it's highly underrated, and personally, I thin t's better then 'Tormato' and 'Big Generator' albums. Well, enough ranting :P\n\n Track #  Title    \n  1  Fly From Here (Overture)    \n  2  Fly From Here, Pt. 1: We Can Fly    \n  3  Fly From Here, Pt. 2: Sad Night At The Airfield    \n  4  Fly From Here, Pt. 3: Madman At The Screens    \n  5  Fly From Here, Pt. 4: Bumpy Ride    \n  6  Fly From Here, Pt. 5: We Can Fly (Reprise)    \n  7  The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be    \n  8  Life On A Film Set    \n  9  Hour Of Need    \n  10  Solitaire    \n  11  Into The Storm    \n  12  Hour Of Need [Full Length Version]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0fcb98a64923d72e687327af3e1c6ef4f0121c3","amp;dn":"Yes+-+Fly+Fom+Here+%28Bonus+Track%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0fcb98a64923d72e687327af3e1c6ef4f0121c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,252,185,138,100,146,61,114,230,135,50,122,243,225,198,239,79,1,33,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

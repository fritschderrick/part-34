Here, Lord Mountbatten narrates his life story using a wealth of historical material from the archives of the world - including much from his own personal collection. This extraordinary 12 episode series spans 70 years of triumph, conflict and glory in the life of this remarkable man who rose to worldwide recognition as both statesman and military hero, yet was tragically assassinated in 1979. It is this tremendous sweep of international events and changes that has been recaptured in ths unique series. Unique because it is not only about, but with the man concerned. The production team, including Lord Mountbatten, revisited many of the locales in which his career was formed - Malta, Burma, Ceylon, Singapore, India. Excerpts have been incuded from many of those whose lives and duties infuenced those of Lord Mountbatten, or were influenced by him. They include the Duke of Windsor, Prince Philip, six former Prime Ministers, General Eisenhower and other key figures in world history. \n\nA Television History by John Terraine\nProduced and Directed by Peter Morley\nNarration spoken by Alec Mango\nA Rediffusion Television Production\n\n\n\n\n6)  The Imperial Enemy \nThe years 1943-1945.\n\nMountbatten takes up command in SE Asia in August 1943 (the film gives a brief resume of the events in the far east up to that point) and sets about raising morale by touring his command and introducing himself and his plans to his troops, and by launching a SEAC newspaper. His first plan for a seaborne attack on the enemy's flank falls through due to the withdrawal of equipment for the European campaign, and he is forced into a land attack from the north. The Japanese attack and their encirclement of Imphal and Kohima provides the British (eventually) with their first victory, partly through Mountbatten's use of air supplies, and he decides to fight on through the monsoon, reaching the Irrawaddy in early 1945, and crossing it in the boats built by Slim's forces. They take Mandalay in March 1945. In this episode, Mountbatten pays tribute to the commanders under him, Stilwell, Wingate (rather modified praise) and, in particular, Slim.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img221.imageshack.us/img221/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/8505/thelifeandtimesoflordmoo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/8505/thelifeandtimesoflordmoo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6422/thelifeandtimesoflordmo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1987 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 224kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 49:25.592\nNumber Of Parts: 12\nPart Size: 785 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c556b672fe606b29e52e9cdcb5d84221b735761f","amp;dn":"Thames+Television+The+Life+and+Times+of+Lord+Mountbatten+06of12+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c556b672fe606b29e52e9cdcb5d84221b735761f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,86,182,114,254,96,107,41,229,46,156,220,181,216,66,33,183,53,118,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

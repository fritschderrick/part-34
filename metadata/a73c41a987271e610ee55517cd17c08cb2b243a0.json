The narrative of Molloy, old and ill, remembering and forgetting, scarcely human, begets a parallel tale of the spinsterish Moran, a private detective sent in search of him, whose own deterioration during the quest joins in with the catalogue of Molloy's woes. Molloy brings a world into existence with finicking certainties, at the tip of whoever is holding the pencil, and trades larger uncertainties with the reader. Then I went back into the house and wrote, It is midnight. The rain is beating on the windows. It was not midnight. It was not raining.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a73c41a987271e610ee55517cd17c08cb2b243a0","amp;dn":"Molloy+by+Samuel+Beckett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a73c41a987271e610ee55517cd17c08cb2b243a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,60,65,169,135,39,30,97,14,229,85,23,205,23,192,140,178,178,67,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

And even worse, there are hardcoded Hebrew subtitles.  Sorry. Really!  This is all that's available right now.\n\nThis is a 24 part television show where three very successful Israeli chefs select the best chef from a huge group of hopefuls.  Background, ethnicity, training and age are not an issue.  Tasting and selections are blind, which I think is brilliant.\n\nThe first seven episodes are the auditions to select the top 30 out of so-many-I-have-no-idea, then the chefs select their teams and mentor them during the kitchen battles and competition where one by one they are eliminatedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and then to the finals.\n\nThe chefs are:\nMeir Adoni, executive chef of Ã¢â‚¬ËœCatitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Israel's best restaurant according to the NY Times)\nAssaf Granit, chef and restaurant owner in the shouk in Jerusalem.\nMoshik Rote, executive chef of Ã¢â‚¬ËœSamhoud &amp; PlacesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in Amsterdam and holds two Michelin stars\n\nFile name: Chef Games S01E02 - Battle of the Knives 480p IggY\nFile type: mp4\nSize: 463  MB\n\nVideo\nLength: 1:07:32\nFrame width: 854\nFrame height:  480\nData rate:  696kbps\nTotal bitrate:  821kbps\nFrame rate:  25 frames/second\n\nAudio\nBit rate:  125 kbps\nChannels: 2 (stereo)\nAudio sample rate:  44kHz\n\nFigured I'd get it out there even without English.  Maybe I'll do the subtitles myself one day although by the time I finish them I'm sure they'll be available. Either way, maybe you'll enjoy it anyway ... I did. And I promise to get the subtitles up here one way or another. If someone knows where to find the raw Hebrew subtitles, I can get them translated so let me know please.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2b5f6313025509bbca00ece48acd68aed3985bc","amp;dn":"Chef+Games+S01E03+-+Extreme+Courses+480p+IggY.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2b5f6313025509bbca00ece48acd68aed3985bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,181,246,49,48,37,80,155,188,160,14,206,72,172,214,138,237,57,133,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

She and her family traveled by covered wagon across the Midwest. Later, Laura and her husband, Almanzo Wilder, made their own covered-wagon trip with their daughter, Rose, to Mansfield, Missouri. There, believing in the importance of knowing where you began in order to appreciate how far you've come, Laura wrote about her childhood growing up on the American frontier. For millions of readers Laura lives on forever as the little pioneer girl in the beloved Little House books.  \n\nRead by Cherry Jones.\n\nBooks Included:\n\n   1. Little House in the Big Woods\n   2. Little House on the Prairie\n   3. Farmer Boy\n   4. On the Banks of Plum Creek\n   5. By the Shores of Silver Lake\n   6. The Long Winter\n   7. Little Town on the Prairie\n   8. These Happy Golden Years\n   9. The First Four Years\n\nThe books are in individual folders.  They have consecutive numbers from the first chapter of the fist book to the last chapter of the last book if you take out of the folders.  They will import into Itunes in numerical order, with albums reading;\n\nBook 1:  Little House in the Big Woods\nBook 2:  Little House on the Prairie\nBook 3:  Farmer Boy \n\nand so on.\n\nNot sure if these are equalized, they seemed fine when we listened to them.  No sudden jumps in volume, but others may be more particular than I am.\n\nLaura Ingalls Wilder once said the reason she wrote her books in the first place was to preserve the stories of her childhood for todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s children, to help them to understand how much America had changed during her lifetime. The popularity of the Little House series of books has grown phenomenally over the years!\n\nSo, let's teach our children what Laura wanted!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db342a025d5e91f3bf38b5f8a71e71d3d56d933a","amp;dn":"Laura+Ingalls+Wilder+Complete+Series+Homeschool+Educational","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db342a025d5e91f3bf38b5f8a71e71d3d56d933a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,52,42,2,93,94,145,243,191,56,181,248,167,30,113,211,213,109,147,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

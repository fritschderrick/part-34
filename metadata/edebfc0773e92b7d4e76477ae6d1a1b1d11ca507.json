The creators of Debtocracy, a documentary viewed by millions of people around the world, present their new production, entitled CATASTROIKA, on the website www.catastroika.com. \n\nThe documentary uncovers the forthcoming results of the current sell-off of the Greek public assets, demanded in order to face the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enormous sovereign debt. Turning to the examples of London, Paris, Berlin, Moscow and Rome, CATASTROIKA predicts what will happen, if the model imposed in these areas is imported in a country under international financial tutelage.\n\nSlavoj Zizek, Naomi Klein, Luis Sepulveda, Ken Loach and Greg Palast talk about the austerity measures, the Greek government as well as the attack against Democracy on Europe, after the general spreading of the financial crisis. Academics and specialists like Dani Rodrik, Alex Callinicos, Ben Fine, Costas Douzinas, Dean Baker and Aditya Chakrabortty present unknown aspects of the privatization programs in Greece and abroad. \n\nJust like Debtocracy, CATASTROIKA is co-produced by the public, which contributed both financially and with ideas to its creation. The documentary will be available free of charge, under creative commons license. High-resolution files will be available for TV and cinema broadcasts in various languages. \n\nThe journalists Aris Chatzistefanou and Katerina Kitidi are responsible for writing and directing the documentary, while Leonidas Vatikiotis undertook its scientific editing. Active Member and Ermis Georgiadis created the soundtrack of CATASTROIKA, while the editing was made by Aris Triantafyllou. Infowar Productions and Thanos Tsantas are responsible for producing the film. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edebfc0773e92b7d4e76477ae6d1a1b1d11ca507","amp;dn":"Catastroika+documentary+-+Greek+subtitles+-+xvid+1920x1080","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edebfc0773e92b7d4e76477ae6d1a1b1d11ca507","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,235,252,7,115,233,43,125,78,118,71,122,230,209,161,177,209,28,165,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

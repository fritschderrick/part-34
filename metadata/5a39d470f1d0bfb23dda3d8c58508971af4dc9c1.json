It is implied that the title of the manga is derived from the &quot;good endings&quot; that are achieved in harem visual novels. Although the story was once concluded in the one shot version, the full version includes identical characters and settings.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a39d470f1d0bfb23dda3d8c58508971af4dc9c1","amp;dn":"GE%3A+Good+Ending+-+Vol.+06","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a39d470f1d0bfb23dda3d8c58508971af4dc9c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,57,212,112,241,208,191,178,61,218,61,140,88,80,137,113,175,77,201,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

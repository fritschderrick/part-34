It does not want to commit a British military force to a foreign war but they have a commitment to protect the Egyptians in Khartoum. They decide to ask General Charles &quot;Chinese&quot; Gordon, something of a folk hero in the Sudan as he had cleared the area of the slave trade, to arrange for the evacuation. Gordon agrees but also decides to defend the city against the forces of the Mahdi - the expected one - and tries to force the British to commit troops.\n\n\n\n***** As Always, My Thanks in advance to those who stay on to seed after their download has been completed it is much appreciated *****\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060588&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060588&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5db0cce3deda9ce67feb7612ca79a394b3dfd0d4","amp;dn":"Khartoum+%281966%29+-+Multi+Audio+%26amp%3B+Subs+%28See+Post%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5db0cce3deda9ce67feb7612ca79a394b3dfd0d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,176,204,227,222,218,156,230,127,235,118,18,202,121,163,148,179,223,208,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

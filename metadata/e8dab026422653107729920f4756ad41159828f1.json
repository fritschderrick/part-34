Lavender Town theme.\n\nThe infamous Lavender Town Syndrome theme I have taken and stretched to an hour. It has been slowed down to an hour's length, and boy is it creepy.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I am not affiliated with GameFreak or Nintendo. Also, this is not the original Lavender Town Syndrome theme. The Syndrome theme is from Pocket Monsters Green Midori, which was a public Japanese release. This particular song was from the non-public Beta of Green. Few gamers have actually heard the Beta LT theme until recent years.\n\nThis is my first torrent, and I used some crappy trackers. Hopefully I will get the concept of trackers, since trackers are terrible to acquire. I'm not sure how people get trackers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8dab026422653107729920f4756ad41159828f1","amp;dn":"Pokemon+Green+Beta%3A+Lavender+Town+-+PaulStretched+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8dab026422653107729920f4756ad41159828f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,218,176,38,66,38,83,16,119,41,146,15,71,86,173,65,21,152,40,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

At this point in our history we understand mental illness and mental health to be largely influenced by biological factors, specifically, workings of the brain. At the same time, we have always known that social factors play a very strong role in promoting mental health and can make big differences in who gets mentally ill, who gets treated for mental illness, and how people can achieve good quality of life after a mental health diagnosis.\n\nThis course is an opportunity to explore how social practices and ideas contribute to the ways in which society, families and individuals are affected by mental health and mental illness. We will look at issues like why some people think mental illness is a myth, how people think about mental health and illness in different cultures, who gets mentally ill and why, how families are affected by mental illness and what interventions are available to treat mental illness and promote mental health.\n\nMore information about this course available at https://www.coursera.org/course/mentalhealth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae9c77b24013902f4ff511e6159eccefe0af0d6a","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Social+Context+of+Mental+Health+and+Illness","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae9c77b24013902f4ff511e6159eccefe0af0d6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,156,119,178,64,19,144,47,79,245,17,230,21,158,204,239,224,175,13,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

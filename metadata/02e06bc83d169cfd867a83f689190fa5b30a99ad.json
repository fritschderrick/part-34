She would spend the next six and a half years captive in the depths of the Colombian jungle. Even Silence Has an End is her deeply moving and personal account of that time. The facts of her story are astounding, but it is Betancourt's indomitable spirit that drives this very special narrative-an intensely intelligent, thoughtful, and compassionate reflection on what it really means to be human.\n\n\n&quot;\nAbout the Author\nBorn December 25, 1961, in BogotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡, Colombia, Ingrid Betancourt was a politician and presidential candidate celebrated for her determination to combat widespread corruption. In 2002 she was taken hostage by the FARC, a brutal terrorist guerrilla organization. For more than six and a half years, the FARC held her hostage in the Colombian jungle. She was rescued on July 2, 2008.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Format: Kindle Edition\n    * File Size: 811 KB\n    * Print Length: 544 pages\n    * Publisher: The Penguin Press (September 21, 2010)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02e06bc83d169cfd867a83f689190fa5b30a99ad","amp;dn":"Even+Silence+Has+an+End+%28mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02e06bc83d169cfd867a83f689190fa5b30a99ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,224,107,200,61,22,156,253,134,122,131,246,137,25,15,165,179,10,153,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Peter Grant, who managed the rock band Led Zeppelin, also managed Bad Company until 1982.\n\nBad Company enjoyed great success throughout the 1970s. Their first three albums, Bad Company (1974), Straight Shooter (1975) and Run With the Pack (1976), reached the top five in the album charts in both the UK and US. Many of their singles, such as &quot;Bad Company&quot;, &quot;Can't Get Enough&quot;, &quot;Good Lovin' Gone Bad&quot;, and &quot;Feel Like Makin' Love&quot;, remain staples of classic rock radio.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStraight Shooter is the second studio album by British supergroup Bad Company. The album was released in April 1975, a month after the release of the single &quot;Good Lovin' Gone Bad&quot; and four months before the album's second single &quot;Feel Like Makin' Love&quot; (see 1975 in music).\n\nThe album reached number 3 in the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200. It was certified gold (500,000 units sold) by the Recording Industry Association of America a month after its release.\n\nMick Ralphs and Simon Kirke revealed on In the Studio (which devoted an episode to Straight Shooter) that the track &quot;Shooting Star&quot; (which told the story of a rock star who died early) was lyrically inspired by the drug and alcohol-related deaths of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPersonnel:\n\nPaul Rodgers: vocals, guitar, piano\n\nMick Ralphs: guitar, keyboards\n\nSimon Kirke: drums\n\nBoz Burrell: bass","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:025805d58beb598a30013f07068dac145ec6791f","amp;dn":"Bad+Company-Straight+Shooter%5B2CD%27s%5D%5B1975%5D%5B2015%5D%5B320KBPS%5D%5BDE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"025805d58beb598a30013f07068dac145ec6791f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,88,5,213,139,235,89,138,48,1,63,7,6,141,172,20,94,198,121,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

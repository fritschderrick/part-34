Mahoney, senior editor for House Beautiful, has produced an impressively illustrated survey of the Gothic style that starts with examples from the English landscape garden and ends with the &quot;transformation&quot; of Gothic in the U.S. since the Civil War. Individual chapters provide a brief history of each example and include information regarding the site's present condition and availability for viewing. Mahoney vividly describes the personalities of notable architects and designers, and her analysis is attuned to the irony inherent in this incredibly varied and sometimes complex aesthetic.

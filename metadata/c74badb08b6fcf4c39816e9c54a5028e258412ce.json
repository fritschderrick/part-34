This book shows what a small group of nerdy, brilliant pioneers can come up with, working in their dark little basements. Too bad these games are essentially &quot;lost&quot; in the Guitar hero cacphony. You didn;t jump aorund when you were conquering the world, but it did make you think and imagine and interact with your friends and family.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c74badb08b6fcf4c39816e9c54a5028e258412ce","amp;dn":"A+Gamut+of+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c74badb08b6fcf4c39816e9c54a5028e258412ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,75,173,176,139,111,207,76,57,129,110,156,84,165,2,142,37,132,18,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

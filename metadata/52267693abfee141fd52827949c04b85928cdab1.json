Faster. Stranger. Harder to keep clean. And ever since, millions have wondered - who is The Man in the White Suit? TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²re about to find out.\n\nBen Collins caught the car the bug young, kicking his dadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s boss in the balls for not giving him a company Jag. This was the attitude that eventually led him to spend seven years sharing a cabin with Jeremy ClarksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s underwear, James MayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s PhD thesis and Richard HammondÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s hairspray. Because he is The Stig.\n\nNow he tells all about life inside the iconic white helmet. What itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s like to guide a blind ex-RAF officer around the Top Gear track; pit a drug dealerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s Mitsubishi Evo against a Trojan tank; set a Vauxhall Monara against Chloe the dancing Ninja; and race double-decker Routemasters against bendy buses. Not to mention all the inside stuff on how the showÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s amazing driving sequences are made.\n\nHe also reveals how he got to be there - setting\n\na Dunsfold lap time faster than Michael SchumacherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s. Breaking records with the best of the best at Daytona and Le Mans.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s an awesome story, told by an amazing man.\n\n\n\nIf you enjoy the book please buy it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52267693abfee141fd52827949c04b85928cdab1","amp;dn":"The+Man+in+the+White+Suit+-+The+Stigs+story.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52267693abfee141fd52827949c04b85928cdab1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,38,118,147,171,254,225,65,253,82,130,121,73,192,75,133,146,140,218,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

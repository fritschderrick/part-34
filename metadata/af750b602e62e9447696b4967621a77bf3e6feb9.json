The war is over, and Eric Smythe\u0019s party was in full swing. All his clever Greenwich Village friends were there. So too was his sister Sara, an independent, outspoken young woman, starting to make her way in the big city. And then in walked Jack Malone, a U.S. \n\nArmy journalist just back from a defeated Germany, a man whose world view was vastly different than that of Eric and his friends. This chance meeting between Sara and Jack and the choices they both made in the wake of it would eventually have profound consequences, both for themselves and for those closest to them for decades afterwards. \n\nSet amidst the dynamic optimism of postwar New York and the subsequent nightmare of the McCarthy era, The Pursuit of Happiness is a great, tragic love story; a tale of divided loyalties, decisive moral choices and the random workings of destiny.\n\nGenre: Historical Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af750b602e62e9447696b4967621a77bf3e6feb9","amp;dn":"The+Pursuit+of+Happiness+by+Douglas+Kennedy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af750b602e62e9447696b4967621a77bf3e6feb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,117,11,96,46,98,233,68,118,150,180,150,118,33,167,123,243,230,254,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It was developed by Big Red Software and published by Domark.\n\nGame overview\nA comical racing game. Every time a menu item is clicked, a funny phrase would play. During the races, the commentators would make funny comments, stereotypically themed to the country they are from.\n\nCustomising\nFor the driver, you could choose from a few different body shapes and change the colour of the clothes. For the vehicle, you could change the colour and decal.\nThere were several different drivers for the player to choose from before the race. Two of these were Jake 'bad' Jackson, and Derek 'Rabbid Dog' Skimkins.\n\n(taken from Wikipedia)\n\nThis is the full game. To play, you need to use both DOSBox (or another DOS emulator) and CloneDriver (or another CCD virtual driver). Also, a patch for the game is included. Not required to play.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f14ff639a535cc2bf5d46e9598b6ff2f051dd13","amp;dn":"Big+Red+Racing+%28Full+ISO%2C+1996+racing+game%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f14ff639a535cc2bf5d46e9598b6ff2f051dd13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,20,255,99,154,83,92,194,191,93,70,233,89,139,111,242,240,81,221,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

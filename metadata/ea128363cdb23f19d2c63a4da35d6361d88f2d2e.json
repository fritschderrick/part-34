What he lacked in charisma and photogenic looks, Orbison made up for in spades with his quavering operatic voice and melodramatic narratives of unrequited love and yearning. In the process, he established rock &amp; roll archetypes of the underdog and the hopelessly romantic loser. These were not only amplified by peers such as Del Shannon and Gene Pitney, but also influenced future generations of roots rockers such as Bruce Springsteen and Chris Isaak, as well as modern country stars the Mavericks.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/roy-orbison-p5072/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/roy-orbison-p5072/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Vik Iyengar):\n\nAlthough it had been years since his last recording, Roy Orbison was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. Perhaps as a result of the newfound interest in his music, he was invited to record with the supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. Orbison had a renewed sense of purpose, and also began recording material for a new solo album. Collaborating with Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty, Orbison re-creates the feel of his old recordings while sounding modern. His voice sounds as strong as ever, and he is still able to hit the high notes that convey a sad, lonely ache. The highlight of the album is &quot;She's a Mystery to Me,&quot; a haunting ballad penned by U2's Bono and the Edge that perfectly plays to all of Orbison's strengths as a singer. Released in the months after his death, Mystery Girl was the highest-charting album of his career and spawned the hit &quot;You Got It&quot; -- it is a shame that Orbison was not around to experience his success. This comeback album represents Roy Orbison at his best.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/mystery-girl-r14594&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/mystery-girl-r14594&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000WGN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000WGN&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.

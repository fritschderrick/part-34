It features real orchestral instruments powered up with drums, percussives sections and singing. It is a huge sound research involving hundreds of tracks mixed up by song, dealing with artificial and acoustical elements as well.\n\nEnjoy! ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f562b63b9660f760c693e18f79ad5fc37d0aa4b","amp;dn":"Spiky+-+Carnival+Symposium+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f562b63b9660f760c693e18f79ad5fc37d0aa4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,86,43,99,185,102,15,118,12,105,62,24,247,154,213,252,55,208,170,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

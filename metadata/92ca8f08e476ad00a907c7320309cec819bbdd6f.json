There was just something cool about being able to get a complete story from the past inside a regular Marvel comic on the spinner rack.\n\nIn hindsight, I probably wouldn't have loved it so much if the small city I live(d) in had a comic shop. I was so happy when I noticed one had opened in '91 or so.\n\nOf course then I blew all of my allowance, and most of my early paychecks in those, from about age 12 to age 20.  :-)\n\nAnyway, the Megazine titles that Marvel published -- and I am pretty confident that they were a Tom Breevort idea -- circa 1994-1996 are reprint titles similar to the 100-Page Monster format (96 pages of comics + covers). Instead of a new Marvel comic combined with 2 or 3 reprints, these have 4 older Marvel issues each issue. None of the Megazines lasted more than 6 issues. (A fact vehemently criticized by Brevoort on #6's letters page.)\n\nThese have new cover art by some great artists, although the covers' DESIGN (much like the original design of the Essential trade paperbacks) is ugly as hell. Darick Robertson, Frank Miller, Michael Golden, Lee Weeks and John Byrne did the first 5 covers, and I'm not sure who did the last one.\n\nAnother cool thing about these is the cover-2-cover scans include all the awful ads for other Marvel releases. Wow, even their mid-90's house ads were terrible.\n\n------\n\nPlease seed and share with our friends here on TPB! If you like this torrent, I'll put up the Spider-Man Megazines, and possibly the other ones, too.  --STFmaryville","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92ca8f08e476ad00a907c7320309cec819bbdd6f","amp;dn":"MARVEL+SUPER-HEROES+MEGAZINE+01-06+%281994-1995%29+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92ca8f08e476ad00a907c7320309cec819bbdd6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,202,143,8,228,118,173,0,169,7,199,50,3,9,206,200,25,187,221,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

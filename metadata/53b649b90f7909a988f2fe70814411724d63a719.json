Designed for PCs running Microsoft Windows, the game uses \na heavily modified version of the Quake engine, called GoldSrc.\n\nIn Half-Life, players assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a recently \ngraduated theoretical physicist who must fight his way out of an underground \nresearch facility whose teleportation experimentations have gone terribly wrong.\nThe game was the first first-person shooter with a story told entirely in-game \nin real time, without the use of cutscenes. On its release, critics hailed \nits overall presentation and numerous scripted sequences, and it won over \n50 Game of the Year awards in 1998-9. Its gameplay influenced first-person \nshooters for years to come, and has since been regarded as one of the greatest \ngames of all time.\n\nHalf-Life: Opposing Force (Commonly referred to as Op4 or OpFor) is an \nexpansion pack for the popular first-person shooter Half-Life, developed by \nGearbox Software and released by Valve Software on October 31, 1999. A \nstand-alone version was also included with the release of Half-Life: Blue Shift. \nThe expansion's single-player mode features the same setting as the original, \nwith the twist that the player is cast not as Gordon Freeman, but as Corporal \nAdrian Shephard, a U.S. Marine. Shephard is sent into the huge underground \nBlack Mesa Research Facility on an undisclosed mission, but things go wrong \nand he finds himself fighting for survival against sinister government agents \nand monstrous aliens.\n\nHalf-Life: Blue Shift is the second, but stand-alone expansion pack for the \nfirst-person shooter computer game Half-Life, developed by Gearbox Software \nand released on June 12, 2001. Like Gearbox's other expansions, Half-Life: \nOpposing Force and Half-Life: Decay, Blue Shift returns to the setting and \ntimeline of the original story, but with a different player character: the \nubiquitous Black Mesa Research Facility security guard Barney Calhoun. As \nBarney, the player attempts to escape the alien invasion caused by the \nresonance cascade and the ensuing military cover-up.\n\nThe Sven Mod in conjunction with the Opposing Force Co-op Mod, and the Decay Mod \nallow in conjunction with the steamless WON2 system for up to sixteen players to \ntraverse through the storylines of the main Half-Life, Opposing Force, and \nDecay campaign as well as several other co-op maps utilizing either an internet \nconnection or a local area network. The online ServerBrowser (allowing online \nplayability) is free and doesn't require any key thanks to the dedicated efforts \nof the Steamless CS Project. This release is a massive update, radicaly increasing\nboth content and stability.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Miscellaneous Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease Note The Following:\n\n.I.\nThe Federation takes no responsibility for any damage that may come to \ncomputer through the trial of this game.

This project seeks to combine a Lite (less than 700m)\nVista build, bootscreen, frontend, registry tweaks, several related \napplications, twenty-plus emulators and tens of thousands of various game \nimages and ROMS in an orderly package. This package would then allow a user \nto easily create a SF personal computer (or any other light PC) that would \nact as any console from the first to sixth generation. This has been a huge\nundertaking but if it is successful this project will provide the PC scene with \nthe first real replacement for consoles.

If you \nwant to find us [6b6e6f636b2c20616e642077652077696c6c20636f6e7461637420796f75].\t\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Known Problems\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(1.) Changing Levels - In the Opposing Force campaign Co-op mod in order to \nchange levels you might from time to time need to restart the server. Usually \nthe sign to re-host the server is when instead of a door (in the normal game) \nyou  find a solid concrete wall making a door sound (subtle...). \n\n(2.) The Mortality of Vital Characters - Main characters such as the 'fat-guard' \nwho opens the door for you on the of1a1.bsp campaign map are easily killed by \nenemies on the harder difficulty settings. This is suspected to be the intention \nof the mod's author, and no future updates of this torrent are expected to deal \nwith this problem.\n\n(3.) Server Bundling - If when you enter the Multiplayer section of any of the \ngames included in this release you don't see any multiplayer games hosted press \nthe 'update' button and wait. The game will connect to the main WON2 server and \npull a list of all currently operational servers.\t\n\n(4.) Hosting Max - Attempting to host two (non dedicated) servers on the same\npersonal computer will cause a memory error. There is no known solution \nfor this problem at this time.\n\n(5.) Decay - Because Decay is a new release the co-op AI ranges between buggy and\nnon-existant. This is a huge issue as many doors are opened based on both players \nhaving passed an invisible checkpoint. Therefore if you wish to play this game you \nwill require a secondary human player. There is no known solution for this problem \nat this time.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Federal Rule\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you like this game, BUY IT.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53b649b90f7909a988f2fe70814411724d63a719","amp;dn":"Half-Life%3A+Co-op+%5BBlueshift+%26+Opposing+Force+%26+Decay%5D+%5BFinal%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53b649b90f7909a988f2fe70814411724d63a719","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,182,73,185,15,121,9,169,136,242,254,112,129,68,17,114,77,99,167,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

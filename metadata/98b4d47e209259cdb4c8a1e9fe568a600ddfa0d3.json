Almost breathtaking in their ferocity, McCormick's \n\nnotes characterize Hopkins as a spoiled crybaby whose only redeeming quality is his ability to \n\nmake music. The album, recorded in three 1962 sessions, consists simply of Hopkins and his \n\nguitar, except for three songs that are performed with a full band. The sound is spare and very \n\nloose, with a re-recording of &quot;T Model Blues&quot; and the dance song &quot;Let's Do the Susie-Q,&quot; a \n\nmusical exhortation that seems unlikely to inspire dancing. A brief and uneven album, Smokes \n\nLike Lightnin' is less compelling than Hopkins' '50s recordings, but strikes an appealingly lazy \n\nacoustic groove.\n\n\nTracks: \n1. T-Model Blues\n2. Jackstropper Blues\n3. You Cook All Right\n4. My Black Name\n5. You Never Miss Your Water\n6. Let's Do the Susie-Q\n7. Ida Mae\n8. Smokes Like Lightning\n9.

Her commanding officer is eccentric, rarely seen on the bridge; her former XO has deserted his post; and her first middy is resentful because he hasn't been promoted as he deserves....\r\n\r\nBut when a first contact mission goes badly wrong, HMS Vanguard and her crew are plunged into an interstellar war against a new and deadly alien threat. And if they don't make it back to friendly space in time, they will merely be the first to die in a new interstellar war. \r\n\r\nNarrated by: Ralph Lister\r\nLength: 13 hrs and 3 mins \r\nFormat: M4A\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:05-17-16\r\nPublisher: Audible Studios","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:598cbab9b59ed9d36e28ab973a10e81e99cee468","amp;dn":"Christopher+Nuttall+-+Vanguard+%28Ark+Royal+%237%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"598cbab9b59ed9d36e28ab973a10e81e99cee468","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,140,186,185,181,158,217,211,110,40,171,151,58,16,232,30,153,206,228,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

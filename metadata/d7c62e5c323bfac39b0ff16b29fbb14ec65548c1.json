It was released in July 2002 as the lead single from their debut album, Hijas del Tomate. The song exists in three versions, Spanish, a version in a mixture of English and Spanish, described as &quot;Spanglish&quot;, and a version in Portuguese. The chorus is identical in the three versions. This song reached number-one in the UK charts, as well as 26 other countries worldwide.\n\nLas Ketchup was first introduced to Columbia through Shaketown Music, a small record label in CÃƒÂ³rdoba, Andalusia, who sent out the group's demo to a number of different record companies.[1] The demo featured the songs &quot;Asereje&quot; and &quot;Kusha Las Payas&quot;. When A&amp;R Javier PortuguÃƒÂ©s and Columbia director RaÃƒÂºl LÃƒÂ³pez listened the demo they, PortuguÃƒÂ©s later told HitQuarters, stared at each other in delight exclaiming, &quot;Wow, this is fantastic!&quot;.[1] At first the intention was to arrange a distribution deal with ShakeTown Music but on hearing the song they realised its international potential and so negotiated for Las Ketchup to sign with Sony.[1]\n\nThe song tells the story of a pimp-like &quot;afro-gipsy, rastafari&quot; character named Diego who walks into a crowded nightclub at midnight, and the DJ, as he sees Diego walk in, plays the &quot;twelve-o'clock anthem&quot;, &quot;the song he desires most&quot;. The chorus is reminiscent of Spanish, but contains no actual words. It may be based on the 1979 rap hit &quot;Rapper's Delight&quot; by Sugarhill Gang.\n\nLas Ketchup - Asereje [Spanish_Version] [480p]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/75895259042737972056.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/75895259042737972056.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/68058155829206637699.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/68058155829206637699.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/46871954480017890881.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/46871954480017890881.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/24145247614993096804.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/24145247614993096804.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/81902563923206950451.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/81902563923206950451.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nLas Ketchup - Asereje - The Ketchup Song [English_Version] [720p_HD]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/72940859252055908436.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/72940859252055908436.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/33442789091309902479.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/33442789091309902479.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7c62e5c323bfac39b0ff16b29fbb14ec65548c1","amp;dn":"Las_Ketchup_-_Asereje_%5BEnglish_%26amp%3B_Spanish_Versions%5D_%5BSbyky%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7c62e5c323bfac39b0ff16b29fbb14ec65548c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,198,46,92,50,59,250,195,155,15,241,107,41,251,177,78,198,85,72,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

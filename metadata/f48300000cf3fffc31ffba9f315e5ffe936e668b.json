Very good audience recordings.  Elvis is upbeat and the shows are great.  The MS has some tape noise.  The &quot;lowlight&quot; of the DS is Sherrill Nielsen's interpretation of Hawaiian Wedding Song - ugghhh!!!!\n\nPress note\n\nStraight Arrow is continuing their collector's series of 2 shows from one evening, released in a single package. This time the producers have chosen two excellent performances from Saturday, March 29, 1975 at the Las Vegas Hilton.\nElvis returned to Nevada in very good form when compared to his final shows of 1974. He included several cuts from soon-to-be-released &quot;TODAY&quot; album rather than some of his usual oldies. Presley's shows were shorter than his previous Vegas visit in August and September because he kept banter to a minimum.\nOn this collection there are worthy performances of &quot;And I Love You So&quot;, &quot;It's Midnight&quot;, &quot;Big Boss Man&quot;, &quot;Burning Love&quot; and the powerful &quot;My Boy&quot;. There are also some rarities, like a one-liner of &quot;Rip It Up&quot;, &quot;Tiger Man&quot; not performed as a medley with &quot;Mystery Train,&quot; and &quot;Hawaiian Wedding Song&quot; sung exclusively by Sherrill Nielsen.\nAs fans have come to expect, the tapes are of very good quality, sourced from early generation copies of original cassettes recorded by the same fan. The double digipak contains liner notes and is filled with photos from the March-April 1975 engagement. As usual, these recordings have been carefully engineered to be presented in the best possible sound.\n\nSilvers - EAC secure mode test &amp; copy - flac front end - you\n\nEAC logs and 300 dpi scans included\n\n\nSet List\n\nCD 1\n\n01 Introduction: Also Sprach Zarathustra\n02 C C Rider\n03 I Got A Woman/Amen\n04 Love Me\n05 If You Love Me (Let Me Know)\n06 And I Love You so\n07 Big Boss Man\n08 It's Midnight\n09 Burning Love/That's Amore (excerpt)\n10 Band Introductions\n11 What'd I Say (James Burton)\n12 Drum Solo (Ronnie Tutt)\n13 Bass Solo (Duke Bardwell)\n14 Piano Solo (Glen D Hardin)\n15 Electric Piano Solo (David Briggs)\n16 School Day (Joe Guercio Orchestra)\n17 My Boy (with 2 false starts)\n18 I'll Remember You\n19 When It's My Time (J S Sumner &amp; The Stamps)\n20 Let Me Be There (with reprise)\n21 Hawaiian Wedding Song (Sherrill Nielsen)\n22 Hound Dog\n23 Can't Help Falling In Love\n24 Closing Vamp\n\nCD 2\n\n01 Introduction: Also Sprach Zarathustra\n02 C C Rider\n03 Rip It Up (excerpt)\n04 I Got A Woman/Amen\n05 Love Me\n06 If You Love Me (Let Me Know)\n07 And I Love You so\n08 Big Boss Man\n09 It's Midnight\n10 Burning Love\n11 Band Introductions\n12 What'd I Say (James Burton)\n13 Drum Solo (Ronnie Tutt)\n14 Bass Solo (Duke Bardwell)\n15 Piano Solo (Glen D Hardin)\n16 Electric Piano Solo (David Briggs)\n17 School Day (Joe Guercio Orchestra)\n18 Introduction Of Billy Swan\n19 My Boy\n20 I'll Remember You\n21 My Heavenly Father (Kathy Westmoreland)\n22 Let Me Be There\n23 The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\n24 Tiger Man\n25 Can't Help Falling In Love\n26 Closing Vamp/Announcements/Fan Comments\n\nRipped by Ozark/Rameses II 15 November 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f48300000cf3fffc31ffba9f315e5ffe936e668b","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+1975-03-29+-+Las+Vegas%2C+USA+%28DS+%26amp%3B+MS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f48300000cf3fffc31ffba9f315e5ffe936e668b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,131,0,0,12,243,255,252,49,255,186,159,49,94,95,254,147,110,102,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

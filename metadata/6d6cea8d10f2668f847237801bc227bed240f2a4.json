Over the past year, they've been extra busy tending to the disasters in the hurricane ravaged South.\n\nCAP Search &amp; Rescue now encapsulates all aspects of real Civil Air Patrol missions including: what you are searching for, where it is located, if it has an Electronic Location Transmitter (ELT), the frequency and modulation of the ELT, the accuracy of the ELT, contents of the emergency kit (flares, smoke, etc) and the radio communication to signal the end of a mission. Combine this with authentic Civil Air Patrol-style search pattern flight plans and you have a completely portable search\nmission, making it incredibly easy to build and install pre-built search missions for you to share, create challenges for yourself or for CAP training!\n\nWith the BONUS Edition, you'll fly these current and past CAP aircraft:\n\n    * Cessna 182T with Garmin 1000 glass panel\n    * Cessna C-172 Skyhawk\n    * Maule MX-260\n    * Gippsland GA8 Airvan\n    * C185 Skywagon\n    * DHC-2 Beaver\n    * L-19 Bird Dog\n\nFor more information, visit the Civil Air Patrol website.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d6cea8d10f2668f847237801bc227bed240f2a4","amp;dn":"FS9+-+FS2004+Abacus+Civil+Air+Patrol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d6cea8d10f2668f847237801bc227bed240f2a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,108,234,141,16,242,102,143,132,114,55,128,27,194,39,190,210,64,242,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

He graduated at London University in 1964 and held junior posts at \nthe London Hospital from that time. In 1970 he joined the Hammersmith Hospital \nas a Registrar and became involved in research and development in \ngynaecological microsurgery. \n\nHe is well known today to audiences throughout the world for his several BBC \ntelevision series, which include The Human Body, Secret Life of Twins and \nSuperhuman, and through which he has shown a great capacity for communicating \noften complex science to a wide public audience. He is Professor of Fertility \nStudies at Imperial College School of Medicine, London University, and is \nworld-renowned as a fertility expert. He also heads the Department of \nReproductive Medicine at the Hammersmith Hospital in London.\n\nIn Human Instints Professor Robert Winston provides a unique insight into what \nit is that makes us human. And it is the story of our extraordinary instincts \nand why we behave the way we do and what other animals reveal about our most \nbasic drives. With intriguing experiments and secret filming he uncovers the \nsurprising science of sex. And helps us understand why one human being could \nlay down their life for another. In exploring survival, sex, competition and \nself-sacrifice, Professor Winston takes viewers on a journey of discovery into \nhuman behaviour, to look at ourselves in an entirely new way. \nHe believes the series is not science for scientists - it is about trying to \ntranslate complex ideas into something easily accessible for all. He thinks \nthe whole area of evolutionary psychology has been largely overlooked but \nthinks it&amp;#039;s fascinating. According to Winston we all carry a prehistoric \nbaggage around with us and don&amp;#039;t have full control over it.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPart 2:\n\nThe instinct to have sex is one of the most potent we possess. It?s vital if we are to produce the next generation. In this programme we find out what it is about the way we look, the way we smell and what we possess, that can attract the ideal mate. \n\n  \nThe Perfect Date\nOur instincts drive all of us to have sex - and so potentially to have children. But the way men and women go about this is very different. Two actors were sent on to a London University campus with hidden cameras to ask a simple question: &quot;Will you sleep with me?&quot; One is a woman asking men and the other a man asking women. The results could not be more different. Just as in the original experiment (by Elaine Hatfield of the University of Hawaii and Russ Clark of the University of North Texas) no women said yes but three-quarters of the men thought it sounded a good idea. \n\n\nA Match Made in Heaven\nWhen looking for a partner people instinctively respond to a whole range of signals. The simplest of these is body shape. For women, a narrow waist and wide hips are a sign of fertility and therefore prove highly attractive to men. Women are instinctively drawn to body shapes that signal good genes. So she is more likely to go for a man with wide shoulders and a narrow waist- a sure signal of both physical strength and a good immune system. \n\n\nLove Rats\nBecause women give birth they can be sure any child they have carries their genes. Men cannot be 100% certain, so they have evolved a means of protecting against the possibility of cheating partners. It?s all down to testicle size - a man?s are bigger than a gorilla?s, but smaller than a chimp?s. A gorilla has a harem of females dedicated to him and him only.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe file have two audio tracks. One is english and one is chinese. The easiest thing is to play the file in VLC player or other player who support two tracks. English is default in VLC player.\n\nPart 1: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3737184/BBC_Human_Instinct_-_Part_1_of_4_-_Robert_Winston&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3737184/BBC_Human_Instinct_-_Part_1_of_4_-_Robert_Winston&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab9fb50cbda644e0af48ca2a1aec8db29b074c81","amp;dn":"BBC+Human+Instinct+-+Part+2+of+4+-+Robert+Winston","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab9fb50cbda644e0af48ca2a1aec8db29b074c81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,159,181,12,189,166,68,224,175,72,202,42,26,236,141,178,155,7,76,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

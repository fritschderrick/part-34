In addition to creating a unique musical sound, he has won praise for his power as a lyricist. His precisely worded narratives, with their sense of humour about daily life, stand as metaphors for the social and economic ills that bedevil his country.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8c6a01a5e7a4d252069eb29a61fc85d5d31a25d","amp;dn":"Oliver+Mutukudzi_Shoko","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8c6a01a5e7a4d252069eb29a61fc85d5d31a25d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,198,160,26,94,122,77,37,32,105,235,41,166,31,200,93,93,49,162,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

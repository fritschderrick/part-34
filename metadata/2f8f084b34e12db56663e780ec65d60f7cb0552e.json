Quality is not impressive. Never trust a ripper who cannot even fill the 700 MiB. But it is complete, it is playable, synch is OK, and it runs in both my standalone DivX players.\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to upload this film here. One torrent has run dry of seeders, one more recent was corrupt and was deleted by the uploader. So I found this working torrent on another site and post it here for you who have become anxious to see the film.\n\nIf it attracts enough interest, I'll order the DVD and make a quality rip.\n\nWidescreen, although this rip has been incorrectly masked and may challenge your display ratio options. Sound is good stereo.\n\nMediaInfo analysis:\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 561 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 47mn\nOveral bit rate                  : 729 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Streaming Video@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default\nMuxing mode                      : Packet Bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 47mn\nBit rate                         : 527 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 5/4\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nStandard                         : PAL\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.051\nStream size                      : 406 MiB\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 47mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nVideo delay                      : 26ms\nStream size                      : 148 MiB\nTitle                            : Audio Stream","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f8f084b34e12db56663e780ec65d60f7cb0552e","amp;dn":"Project+X+%281987%29+Matthew+Broderick+%28Can+a+chimp+fly+a+plane%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f8f084b34e12db56663e780ec65d60f7cb0552e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,143,8,75,52,225,45,181,102,99,231,128,236,101,214,15,124,176,85,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

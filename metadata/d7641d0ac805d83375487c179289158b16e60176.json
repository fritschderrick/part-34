Credit, web links, instructions and documentation were added where applicable. \n\nGenres include: Action, RPG, Puzzle, Arcade, Text, Shooting &amp; Adventure\n\nThese games were chosen because they have a small footprint (won&amp;#039;t hog disk space) and run well even on less powerful laptops (and Desktop PC&amp;#039;s, of course) running recent versions of Windows.  No additional emulators or old DosBox type stuff is required to run.  Games were run and tested in Windows XP.\n\nSome of the games are good for a quick diversion, while others are deep and/or addictive types.\n\nIf you&amp;#039;re looking for a nice set of games to kill time on your laptop, some of which can be run in windowed mode, then grab this torrent!\n\nThe Games this time &amp;#039;round include:\n\nCastlevania - The New Generation\nSaboteur\nFinal Fantasy - Dark Cloud\nRunesword\nMontezuma&amp;#039;s Revenge Remake\nDemon Attack Remake\nCute Knight\nRiseout\nCrypts of Despair\nLode Runner Remake\nEquinox\nHurrican \nStrike Ball\nThe Run\nRaid on Bungeling Bay Remake\n\nAnd more!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7641d0ac805d83375487c179289158b16e60176","amp;dn":"20+More+Laptop+Games+for+Windows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7641d0ac805d83375487c179289158b16e60176","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,100,29,10,200,5,216,51,117,72,124,23,146,137,21,139,22,230,1,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

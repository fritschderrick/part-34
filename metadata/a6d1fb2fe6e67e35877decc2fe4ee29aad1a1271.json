Ben doesn't even seem to get it when he's told to report as 'little Mary' to the old cook, whose words cowboy is something you do only if you have nothing better gradually become clear. Instead of an exciting heroic macho life, it's endless hard work, dumb chores and embarrassment, even getting literally caught with his pants down, robbed of his horse, witnessing unpunished crimes, etc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6d1fb2fe6e67e35877decc2fe4ee29aad1a1271","amp;dn":"The+Culpepper+Cattle+Co.++%28Western+1972%29++Gary+Grimes%2C+Billy+Gre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6d1fb2fe6e67e35877decc2fe4ee29aad1a1271","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,209,251,47,230,230,126,53,135,125,236,194,254,78,226,154,173,26,18,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

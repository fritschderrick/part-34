Darkness and ice extend across the polar regions and only a few remarkable survivors gamble on remaining. We join a female polar bear trekking into the Arctic mountains to give birth as the first blizzards arrive. Out on the frozen ocean, the entire world's population of spectacled eider ducks brave the winter in a giant ice hole kept open by ferocious currents. Arctic forests transform into a wonderland of frost and snow - the scene of a desperate and bloody battle between wolf and bison, but also where a remarkable alliance between raven and wolverine is made. Beneath the snow lies a magical world of winter survivors. Here tiny voles dodge the clutches of the great grey owl, but cannot escape the ultimate under-show predator - the least weasel. Midwinter and a male polar bear wanders alone across the dark, empty icescape. Below the snow, polar bear cubs begin life in an icy den while fantastical auroras light the night skies above. In Antarctica, we join male emperor penguins in their darkest hour, battling to protect precious eggs from fierce polar storms. Weddell seals escape to a hidden world of jewel-coloured corals and alien-looking creatures but frozen devastation follows as sinister ice stalactites reach down with deadly effect.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1527 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 400\nVideo Aspect Ratio:  1.800 (16:9) \nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) \nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2ch\nAudio Languages: English \nRunTime per Part 59.mins \nNumber of Parts: 7\nPart Size: 702 MB\nSource: PDTV\nEncoded by: Harry65\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc87fb2a006c39689682a457c2f5f051a7bfd2fd","amp;dn":"BBC.Frozen.Planet.5of7.Winter.PDTV.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc87fb2a006c39689682a457c2f5f051a7bfd2fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,135,251,42,0,108,57,104,150,130,164,87,194,245,240,81,167,191,210,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

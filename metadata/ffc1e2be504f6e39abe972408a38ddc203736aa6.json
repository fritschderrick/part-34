'Thunder' is the next one to strike. And boy, will it cause a thunderclap. Kept an exclusive ID in their sets for the past few weeks, 'Thunder' has been roaring the EDM surfaces as a much-wanted ID. The official follow-up to Top 5 Beatport main chart rocker and Ummet Ozcan collab 'The Code' and Armin van Buuren smash 'D#Fat', is another original take on musical fusion. 'Thunder' has the right claps, a fit melody and a pay-off that would shake the foundations of every club it meets - no exceptions granted.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffc1e2be504f6e39abe972408a38ddc203736aa6","amp;dn":"W%26amp%3BW+-+Thunder+%28Original+Mix%29.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffc1e2be504f6e39abe972408a38ddc203736aa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,193,226,190,80,79,110,57,171,233,114,64,138,56,221,194,3,115,106,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

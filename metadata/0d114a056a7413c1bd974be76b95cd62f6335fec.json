Seymour (Herschell Gordon Lewis)\n\nNotoriously terrible film, worse than you ever imagined a film could be.  Herschell Lewis purchased the unfinished &quot;Terror at Halfday&quot; from director Bill Rebane, added some &quot;rock&quot; music and &quot;sexy&quot; scenes, and penned surreal narration to make the thing seem mysterious. Essentially a space capsule returns to earth, lands in a field in Wisconsin, and the astronaut goes missing. Very tall man in a space suit with horrible skin disease is terrorizing the countryside near the capsule. Coincidence? Oh wait it gets better. Featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000 and (later) TCM Underground.\n\nMPEG_4 encoded with Nero Digital\n23.97 frames per second (NTSC)\nResolution 604x464\nAudio AAC-HE\n\nTorrent includes theatrical trailer\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d114a056a7413c1bd974be76b95cd62f6335fec","amp;dn":"Monster+A-Go+Go","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d114a056a7413c1bd974be76b95cd62f6335fec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,17,74,5,106,116,19,193,189,151,75,231,107,149,205,98,246,51,95,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

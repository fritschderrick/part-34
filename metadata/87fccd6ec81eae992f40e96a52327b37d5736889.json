Flown not only by the US Air Force but by the air forces of Israel, Saudi Arabia and Japan, and with almost 30 years service the F-15 is the world's foremost operational air superiority and intercept warplane. Steve Davies and Doug Dildy draw on a vast array of sources, including combat records, technical documents and unpublished first-hand accounts from the pilots themselves, to tell the story of this amazing plane. Containing over 100 breathtaking colour photographs and detailed technical information, this definitive history and guide to the world's most successful jet fighter is a 'must have' for anyone interested in modern aviation. \nContents\nIntroduction Ã‚Â· The 'FX Competition' Ã‚Â· The McDonnell Douglas 199-B Design Ã‚Â· Testing Ã‚Â· Entry into Service Ã‚Â· Improved Eagles and the MSIP Ã‚Â· Operational Units and Combat records Ã‚Â· Foreign Military Sales Eagles\n\ntitle link:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87fccd6ec81eae992f40e96a52327b37d5736889","amp;dn":"F-15+Eagle+Engaged%3A+The+World%27s+Most+Successful+Jet+Fighter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87fccd6ec81eae992f40e96a52327b37d5736889","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,252,205,110,200,30,174,153,47,64,233,106,82,50,123,55,213,115,104,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

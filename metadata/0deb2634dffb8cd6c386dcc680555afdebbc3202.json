They were formed by Graham Massey, Martin Price and Gerald Simpson, and they released their debut Newbuild in 1988. The band really hit the big time during the &quot;second summer of love&quot; in 1989 when their song &quot;Pacific State&quot; was picked up by Radio 1 DJ Gary Davies. Davies played the record every day for 3 months on his national primetime lunchtime show until it was released as a single. His promotion singlehandedly helped propel the acid house group to the top of the UK charts and into the public consciousness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0deb2634dffb8cd6c386dcc680555afdebbc3202","amp;dn":"808+State+-+Utd.+State+90","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0deb2634dffb8cd6c386dcc680555afdebbc3202","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,235,38,52,223,251,140,214,195,134,220,198,128,85,90,253,235,188,50,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

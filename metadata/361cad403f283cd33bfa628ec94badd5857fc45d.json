Since that group split in 1989, Bush has enjoyed stints with Emmylou HarrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nash Ramblers, been a session musician for a number of country and bluegrass musicians, and released seven solo albums. He has been a restless explorer of musical genres, applying himself to rock, blues, funk, and jazz along the way. Circles Around Me is his eighth album and appears, like the five before it, on the roots label Sugar Hill. It provides an excellent showcase for his talents as mandolin player, fiddler, singer, and songwriter as well as a reminder of his role in promoting the Ã¢â‚¬Å“newgrassÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ phenomenon.\n\nThe first four tracks work effectively as a capsule of BushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main styles. The title track opens with fingerpicked guitar before BushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mandolin and Scott VestalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s banjo enter gently. The voice is similarly subdued, a soft country burr rather than full-throated bluegrass vocals. Here, as in later songs on the album, Bush brings to mind James Taylor; many of his contemporary songs (as opposed to the traditional numbers or bluegrass classics) evoke the post-Taylor 1970s AOR style that provided the basic aesthetic for country rock and progressive roots bands such as the New Grass Revival. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a nostalgic song, then, and one that takes Bush full circle even as it deploys a lyric about having circles run around him. As the song progresses, it receives solid support from the other members of BushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s band (Byron House on bass, Chris Brown on drums, and Stephen Mougin on guitar), ending in a space somewhere between rock and bluegrass.\n\nMandolin kicks off the second trackÃ¢â‚¬â€a take on the traditional Ã¢â‚¬Å“Diamond JoeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€and the pace is immediately increased, the vocals more strained. VestalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s banjo keeps the track rolling along, and Mougin takes a neat guitar break. The group shifts up another gear with a version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Left Me AloneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Tom Gray &amp; Jerry Stuart, which employs harmony vocals throughout and attains the illusion of timelessness that the best bluegrass and old-time music can evoke. BushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mandolin is at its most Bill Monroe-esque here, and the banjo attains that strange combination of tightness and looseness that is one of bluegrassÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most appealing features. The fourth track is an instrumental, a slow and sad number entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Old North WoodsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ written by Bush and saturated with the ringing tones of his mandolin and MouginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s harmony mandolin. Extra violins, under the arrangement of guest bassist Edgar Meyer, add welcome texture.\n\nThe remainder of the album provides variations on these main types of Bush material. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blue MountainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Junior HeywoodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are instrumental workouts that act as showcases for the band. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blue MountainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a celebration of newgrass possibilities, allowing as much space for an electric bass break as for the more Ã¢â‚¬Å“traditionalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ instruments. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Junior HeywoodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ adds Jerry DouglasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dobro and Edgar MeyerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bowed bass to broaden the sound palette. Both tracks are utterly compelling and add considerable variety to the musical program.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Roll on Buddy, Roll OnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Midnight on the DeepÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feature bluegrass legend Del McCoury on guitar and vocals, and provide classic harmony singing; both are songs associated with Bill Monroe, and the versions are as faithful as they could be. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Ballad of Stringbean And EstelleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is in a less classic style, but retains a Monroe connection, telling the somber tale of the murder of MonroeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former banjoist David Ã¢â‚¬Å“StringbeanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Akeman. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s co-written by Bush, Verlon Thompson, and Guy Clark, the three musicians having collaborated previously on ClarkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fine Boats to Build album. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Souvenir BottlesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gold Heart LocketÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are newgrass songs, though quite distinct. The former, a reconstruction of a 1979 New Grass Revival classic, is a band-on-the-road reminiscence that intersperses its verses about (now long-gone) days of carousing with extended instrumental breaks. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gold Heart LocketÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, again featuring Douglas, is the finest of the new songs. Bush sets it going with a beautiful mandolin melody and a heartfelt vocal. Like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Circles Around MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, it comes from the pen of Jeff Black and is another of those post-Taylor 1970s countryesque numbers, all rolling banjos, dobro, and keening harmony vocals at the chorus.\n\nBush officially closes the album (and the circle) by reprising another New Grass Revival song, the early Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whisper My NameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not quite over, as a bonus cut of Robert JohnsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hot TamalesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ unexpectedly provides the funkiest, catchiest number of the collection. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sign that, while Sam Bush may be circling home, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still got the inclination to head off down the road again.\n\nAll in all, this is an excellent collection of material from a practitioner at the top of his game. It should appeal both to hardcore bluegrass fans and to those desirous of a trip back to the progressive spirit of the 1970s, arguably one of country musicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most interesting decades.\n-Richard Elliott, popmatters.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:361cad403f283cd33bfa628ec94badd5857fc45d","amp;dn":"Sam+Bush+-+Circles+Around+Me+%5B2009%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"361cad403f283cd33bfa628ec94badd5857fc45d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,28,173,64,63,40,60,211,59,250,98,142,201,75,173,213,133,127,196,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

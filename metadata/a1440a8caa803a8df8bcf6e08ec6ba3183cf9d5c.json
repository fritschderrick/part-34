The guy making these started with rearranging clips to create a whole new Trek universe. Then, he started adding audio clips from the actors in other shows. To top it off he started adding his own CGI to make the stories complete. These will leave you in tears from laughing...\r\n\r\nSo why make a torrent if they are all on YouTube? After seeing some videos pulled here and there I was worried that they would be taken down for copyright complaints, so I started downloading them. Sure enough, lots of them got pulled. Thanks CBS... This guy made them for fun and didn't make any profit. Plus, it reignited my passion for Star Trek. I have rewatched all of TNG on Netflix because of these. But alas, corporate logic wins.\r\n\r\nThese are just 100 of these gems. Look for other batches here:\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your great contributions to the internet General Grin!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1440a8caa803a8df8bcf6e08ec6ba3183cf9d5c","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Parodies+%28Episodes+1+-+100%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1440a8caa803a8df8bcf6e08ec6ba3183cf9d5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,68,10,140,170,128,58,141,248,188,246,224,142,198,186,49,131,207,157,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

This pivotal case is the first for rookie detective Hasan, the brightest and most promising student in his class; the last for Chief Ferman, whose pending retirement looms; and a career-defining challenge for the passionate and impulse-driven Idris. The suspect list includes a line-up of close family members and local ne'er-do-wells, plus one wealthy overlord who strikes fear and dread at the mere mention of his name. And as the three detectives winnow the list of suspects, their revelations pose more questions than they answer.\n\nWritten and directed by Yavuz Turgul, Av Mevsimi is a masterpiece of cinema noir. With its impeccably-crafted screenplay, and a constellation of perfectly-cast characters, every minute of its nearly two-and-a-half-hour runtime is an exercise in mindful pacing and plot development that weaves a richly sinister tapestry of mystery and intrigue. \n\n\nFile Name .........................................:Av.Mevsimi.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 2,209,300,480 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:24:49\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x400 (AR: 1.800)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1580 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.219 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 448 kb/s [6 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1668191/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1668191/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Turkish\nSubtitles: English, Spanish and Portuguese (srt)\n\nPosted originally at KG by varfilmKG, whom we thank\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8b8eb3495c5ee11b1910b91bbe32a8fdaea6d63","amp;dn":"Yavuz+Turgul+-+Av+mevsimi+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8b8eb3495c5ee11b1910b91bbe32a8fdaea6d63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,184,235,52,149,197,238,17,177,145,11,145,187,227,42,143,218,234,109,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

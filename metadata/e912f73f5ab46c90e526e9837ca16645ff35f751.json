I'm not sure how &quot;limited edition&quot; this set actually was.  I think every copy had the same pseudo-serial number printed on the outer cardboard slipcase.\n\nBeing a Cleopatra release, this had its usual share of mislabeled songs on the CD case.  Below is the proper track listing.  I also added the year of release to the songs' names in the files.  \n\n1-1 \tNoise Unit - Paradise     8:38   \n1-2 \tNoise Unit - Biosphere     9:37   \n1-3 \tDelerium - Amnesia     9:21   \n1-4 \tPro-Tech - Eros     6:43   \n1-5 \tEquinox - Phenomena     5:46   \n1-6 \tSynaesthesia - Door To The Other Side     11:14   \n1-7 \tNoise Unit - The Drain     6:50   \n1-8 \tFront Line Assembly - Amorphous     4:56   \n\n2-1 \tNoise Unit - Miracle     6:46   \n2-2 \tNoise Unit - Inner Chaos     7:52   \n2-3 \tDelerium - Ambience     4:48   \n2-4 \tEquinox - Electronic Dream     9:03   \n2-5 \tPro-Tech - Re-Thread     7:44   \n2-6 \tSynaesthesia - Floatation     8:38   \n2-7 \tNoise Unit - Alle Gegan Alle     4:32   \n2-8 \tNoise Unit - Penance     6:05   \n2-9 \tFront Line Assembly - Mutate \t5:42  \n\n\nand here it is again separated by each group's tracks    :-)\n\n2-3 \t**Delerium - Ambience     4:48   \n1-3 \t**Delerium - Amnesia     9:21   \n\n2-4 \tEquinox - Electronic Dream     9:03   \n1-5 \tEquinox - Phenomena     5:46   \n\n1-8 \t**Front Line Assembly - Amorphous     4:56   \n2-9 \tFront Line Assembly - Mutate \t5:42  \n\n2-7 \tNoise Unit - Alle Gegan Alle     4:32   \n1-2 \tNoise Unit - Biosphere     9:37   \n2-2 \tNoise Unit - Inner Chaos     7:52   \n2-1 \tNoise Unit - Miracle     6:46   \n1-1 \tNoise Unit - Paradise     8:38   \n2-8 \tNoise Unit - Penance     6:05   \n1-7 \tNoise Unit - The Drain     6:50   \n\n1-4 \tPro-Tech - Eros     6:43   \n2-5 \tPro-Tech - Re-Thread     7:44   \n\n1-6 \tSynaesthesia - Door To The Other Side     11:14   \n2-6 \tSynaesthesia - Floatation     8:38   \n\n**new songs making their first appearance on this compilation\n\n.wma in a variable bit rate\n\n***********************\n\nGrab and go is never cool.  Please help keep these torrents alive.  Whenever you grab a torrent, you should continue to seed for others, at least until your ratio reaches 1.0 or higher.  I'm still kind of new to this, but I believe that if you make any changes to what you've downloaded or move them from their original download location, it will stop seeding.  I usually COPY my music files from my download folder to an empty folder on my desktop, rename them how I like, then add them to my music library.  This leaves the torrent in its original condition and location so it will seed for others.\n\nWe've all been frustrated by dead and incomplete torrents.  This wouldn't happen if everyone seeded until their ratio got over 1.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e912f73f5ab46c90e526e9837ca16645ff35f751","amp;dn":"Front+Line+Assembly%2C+Delerium+-+Cryogenic+Studio+2+Bill+Leeb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e912f73f5ab46c90e526e9837ca16645ff35f751","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,18,247,63,90,180,108,144,229,38,233,131,124,161,102,69,255,53,247,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

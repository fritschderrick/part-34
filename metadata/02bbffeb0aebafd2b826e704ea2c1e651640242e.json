Rose came up to bat in the first inning against the San Diego Padres Eric Show and on the fourth pitch lined a clean single to left center. As he reached first base, thousands of camera flash bulbs fired off rapidly, his teammates mobbed him, fireworks exploded above the stadium and the crowd overwhelmed him with an unprecedented nine-minute standing ovation. In 1963 Pete Rose ran to first base on a walk. Baseball was never the same. From Pete's first at bat to that immortal September evening where history was made, &quot;4192&quot; traces the Hit King's rise as one of baseball's greatest and most controversial stars. Pete Rose was perhaps the most versatile player in Major League Baseball history\n\nThis is an .ISO of the original DVD\n\nAudio options are English and Spanish ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02bbffeb0aebafd2b826e704ea2c1e651640242e","amp;dn":"4192%3A+The+Crowning+of+the+Hit+King+%282010%29+NTSC+DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02bbffeb0aebafd2b826e704ea2c1e651640242e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,187,255,235,10,235,175,210,184,38,231,4,234,44,30,101,22,64,36,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

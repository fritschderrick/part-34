They formed in the mid 80s in the city of Amparo, close to the metropolis of SÃƒÂ£o Paulo.\n\nThe founding line up was Juca on vocals and bass, Paulo and Elias on guitars, and Beba on drums. They recorded two demo tapes, well received on the times of tape trading between the bands and zines, and in 1990 they recorded and released their debut studio album, Rotten Authorities. The album's sound could be compared to Dark Angel and Whiplash.\n\nDespite being one of the more liked bands of the Brazilian thrash metal scene at the time, they split up soon after the release of Rotten Authorities, since they couldn't find another drummer after Beba left the band.\n\nDuring the rest of the 1990s, the band members played in many other bands.\n\nIn 2000, the band reformed with the original line up, but with some differences in playing; Juca got only the vocal works and Paulo got the bass instead of guitars. With this line up, they released two more albums, Psychotic Mind in 2002 and Welcome To Your Hell in 2006. Their first album was also re-released. The band have been playing throughout Brazil, being opening acts for famous bands such as Exodus on their latest South American tour.\nCurrent Line up\n\n    Juca - Vocals\n    Elias - Guitars\n    Paulo - Bass\n    Beba - Drums\n1. \tHelliday \t04:33 \t \n2. \t4:00 A.M.

But what about big data? This hands-on introduction shows you how Spring Data makes it relatively easy to build applications across a wide range of new data access technologies such as NoSQL and Hadoop.\n\nThrough several sample projects, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how Spring Data provides a consistent programming model that retains NoSQL-specific features and capabilities, and helps you develop Hadoop applications across a wide range of use-cases such as data analysis, event stream processing, and workflow. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also discover the features Spring Data adds to SpringÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existing JPA and JDBC support for writing RDBMS-based data access layers.\n\nLearn about SpringÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s template helper classes to simplify the use ofdatabase-specific functionality\nExplore Spring DataÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s repository abstraction and advanced query functionality\nUse Spring Data with Redis (key/value store), HBase(column-family), MongoDB (document database), and Neo4j (graph database)\nDiscover the GemFire distributed data grid solution\nExport Spring Data JPA-managed entities to the Web as RESTful web services\nSimplify the development of HBase applications, using a lightweight object-mapping framework\nBuild example big-data pipelines with Spring Batch and Spring Integration ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a3628765d306c329c04ea26aa2df1107f60adc8","amp;dn":"Spring+Data","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a3628765d306c329c04ea26aa2df1107f60adc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,54,40,118,93,48,108,50,156,4,234,38,170,45,241,16,127,96,173,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

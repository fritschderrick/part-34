The film tells the story of four generations of a Russian Jewish immigrant family of musicians whose careers parallel the history of American popular music. The majority of the film's animation was completed through rotoscoping, a process in which live actors are filmed and the subsequent footage is used for animators to draw over. However, the film also uses a variety of other mixed media including water colors, computer graphics, live action shots, and archival footage.\n\nCast\n\n    * Ron Thompson as Tony Belinksy and Pete Belinksy\n    * Jerry Holland as Louie\n    * Richard Singer as Benny Belinksy\n    * Lisa Jane Persky as Bella\n    * Jeffrey Lippa as Zalmie Belinksy\n    * Marya Small as Frankie Hart\n    * Hilary Beane as Showgirl\n    * Robert Beecher as Hobo #2\n    * Gene Borkan as Izzy\n    * Beatrice Colen as Prostitute\n    * Frank Dekova as Crisco\n    * Ben Frommer as Nicky Palumbo\n    * Roz Kelly as Eva Tanguay\n    * Amy Levitt as Nancy\n    * Richard Moll as Poet\n    * Elsa Raven as Hannele\n    * Vincent Schiavelli as Theatre Owner\n    * Leonard Stone as Leo\n    * Eric Taslitz as Little Pete\n    * Lynda Wiesmeier as The Blonde\n\nSoundtrack\n\n* &quot;A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall&quot; written by Bob Dylan\n* &quot;American Pop Overture&quot; arranged by Lee Holdridge\n* &quot;Anything Goes&quot; written by Cole Porter\n* &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; written by Herman Hupfeld\n* &quot;Bill&quot; written by Jerome Kern/Wodehouse/Oscar Hammerstein II, performed by Helen Morgan\n* &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; written by Carl Perkins\n* &quot;Body &amp; Soul&quot; written by Johnny Green / Edward Heyman / Frank Eyton / Robert Sour\n* &quot;California Dreamin'&quot; written by The Mamas &amp; the Papas\n* &quot;Cantaloupe Island&quot; composed by Herbie Hancock\n* &quot;Charleston&quot; written by Cecil Mack/Jimmy Johnson\n* &quot;Crazy on You&quot; written by Ann Wilson / Nancy Wilson / Roger Fisher of Heart\n* &quot;Devil With The Blue Dress On&quot; written by Shorty Long\n* &quot;Don't Think Twice, It's Alright&quot; written by Bob Dylan\n* &quot;Free Bird&quot; written by Collins / Vanzandt, performed by Lynyrd Skynyrd\n* &quot;Give My Regards to Broadway&quot; written by George M.

The film covers American music from the pre-jazz age through soul, '50s rock, drug-laden psychadelia, and punk, finally ending with the onset of new wave in the early 1980s.\n\nIf nothing else, Ralph Bakshi is an innovator. He has been ever since he did the first X-rated cartoon, FRITZ THE CAT. AMERICAN POP is a daring concept; a feature length, multigenerational saga that tells the story of an immigrant family's American adventure. When it works (and that's MOST of the time), it works WELL. Bakshi did his historical homework on this one, as well as the musical homework required in telling the story of a family of entertainers. His characters achieve the goal that EVERY cartoonist tries for; on some level, we find ourselves identifying with those characters, and CARING about them... ALL of them, from the turn of the century song plugger on the streets of New York City, to the Heavy Metal rocker who finally achieves the American Dream. AMERICAN POP is a breakthru for the art of animation. It's a successfully mounted drama, done in animation. Disney came close sometimes, but Bakshi boldly went where Disney didn't dare to.\n\nFor anyone who loves animation, and anyone who loves music...\n\nR1 America - (Columbia)\n\nSubtitles:  English, Spanish, French\nAspect Ratio:  1.85:1\nPicture Format:  ANAMORPHIC\nTV System:  NTSC\nSoundtrack(s):  English &amp; Spanish Dolby Digital 2.0\nCase type:  Keep Case (Amaray)\n\nNo shrinkage of ANY kind.\nComes with ALL artwork.

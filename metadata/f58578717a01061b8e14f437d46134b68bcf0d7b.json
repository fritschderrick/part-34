It addresses researchers and process engineers alike. The scope of the series includes all classes of materials - metals, inorganic non-metallic materials, polymers and composites - in the form of bulk materials, thin films and layered structures as well as micro- and nanostructured forms. All aspects of materials processing from fundamental understanding to innovative strategies and methods of practical process implementation and control are covered. It is the aim ofthe series to provide comprehensive information on the science and application ofleading-edge and well-established processing technologies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f58578717a01061b8e14f437d46134b68bcf0d7b","amp;dn":"Springer+Series+in+Materials+Processing+%5B5+Vol.%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f58578717a01061b8e14f437d46134b68bcf0d7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,133,120,113,122,1,6,27,142,20,244,55,212,97,52,182,139,207,13,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

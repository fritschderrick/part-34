The song was written solely by Swift and produced by Nathan Chapman together with Swift. It was released on November 15, 2010, by Big Machine Records as the second single from Swift's third studio album, Speak Now. According to Swift, &quot;Back to December&quot; is the first time she ever apologizes to someone in a song, something that she never did before. Upon its release as a promotional single, critics speculated that the song is about Taylor Lautner, Swift's ex-boyfriend, although neither Swift nor Lautner has confirmed nor denied these allegations. &quot;Back to December&quot; is considered an orchestral country pop ballad and its lyrics are a remorseful plea for forgiveness for breaking up with a former lover.\n\n&quot;Back to December&quot; was positively received by critics, who regarded it as one of the highlights of Speak Now. Critics have praised the song for its expressive lyrics, its indelible melody, and Swift's vocal improvement. The song enjoyed commercial success in United States, debuting at number six on the Billboard Hot 100, and at number seven in Canada. Internationally, the song received moderate success, peaking at number twenty-four in New Zealand, and number twenty-six in Australia. Swift has performed &quot;Back to December&quot; in several live appearances, notably at the 44th annual Country Music Association Awards and at the 38th American Music Awards.\n\nAccording to Swift, &quot;Back to December&quot; is an apology to a former lover in the form of a song, something that she has never done before. She continued, &quot;I've never felt the need to apologize in a song before. But in the last two years I've experienced a lot, [including] a lot of different kinds of learning lessons. And sometimes you learn a lesson too late and at that point you need to apologize because you were careless.&quot; Based on the lyrics, critics have speculated that the song is Swift's apology to her ex-boyfriend, The Twilight Saga actor Taylor Lautner. However, neither Swift nor Lautner has confirmed or denied these rumors. &quot;Back to December&quot; was first released as a promotional single from Speak Now on October 12, 2010 as an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store leading up to the album release. On November 15, 2010, the song was then released as the second single from Speak Now.\n\nThe song has been well received by music critics. Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone gave the song a positive review commenting, &quot;Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough.&quot; Jonathan Keefe from Slant Magazine complimented Swift's ability &quot;to write an indelible melody&quot; and praised the production of the song, writing &quot;[the song] showcase(s) Swift's unique knack for matching the overall tone of a melody to the broader themes of a song&quot;. He added that &quot;it isn't easy to make a melancholy song like &quot;Back to December&quot; sound catchy at the same time, but that's what Swift does, and it's an impressive trick.&quot; Bobby Peacock from Roughstock gave the song four stars out of five and praised Swift's vocal, saying that &quot;it's her best vocal since &quot;Tim McGraw&quot;&quot;. He concluded that &quot;[the song] feels a little more focused, a little more mature and a little better-sung than her previous material.&quot;\n\nRyan Brockington from New York Post lauded the song, writing &quot;itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a very surprising, and somewhat brilliant, apology track where Taylor sings about wishing to fix a relationship she wished she wouldn't have ruined in the first place.&quot; His point was echoed by Rudy Klapper from Sputnikmusic, who described the song as a &quot;regret-filled apology&quot;. Stephen M. Deusner from The 1953 gave the song a thumbs-up and praised Swift as &quot;an expressive singer&quot;, calling the song &quot;a dark fantasy of apology and reconciliation&quot; which is &quot;a true heartbreaker&quot;. Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe graded the production of the song as &quot;B&quot;, complimenting the lyrics in particular, by writing &quot;itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always a good sign when thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a line as memorable as that one, the kind that lingers around in your head more than the song itself.&quot; He also added that he &quot;appreciate(s) the restrained vocal, though a more varied melody wouldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve made the chorus quite a bit more distinctive.&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8486cd8f79508347517d17ed285b552a992d464","amp;dn":"Taylor+Swift+-+Back+To+December+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8486cd8f79508347517d17ed285b552a992d464","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,72,108,216,247,149,8,52,117,23,209,126,210,133,181,82,169,146,212,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

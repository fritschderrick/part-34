Felt Fashion captures the art and sophistication that is possible with handmade felt, while keeping it simple and attainable for anyone to master. Whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a collar or an entire dress, each project is irresistible and brings felting to an entirely new level. The author demonstrates several basic felting techniques including: basic wet felting, needle felting, nuno, and punch needle feltÃ‚Â­ing. For the more advanced fiber artist and sewer, she provides patterns and instructions for original clothing designs including vests, jackets, and skirts. Felt Fashion is a standout from other felting books for its scope, originality, and its distinct ties to couture.\n\nAbout the Author\nJenne Giles is a San Francisco-based felting artist whose work ranges from traditional fine arts and crafts to innovative performance and installation art.

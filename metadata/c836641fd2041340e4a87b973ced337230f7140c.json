This book, which provided key source material for the film, is an unexpurgated collection of the views and opinions of South Africa's first Black president, and it draws on Danny SchechterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forty-year relationship with &quot;Madiba,&quot; as Nelson Mandela is known in his native South Africa.  \n\nEach chapter of this unique portrait corresponds to a letter of the alphabet, and the letters cover major and minor, unexpected and fascinating themes in MandelaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and his impact on others: Athlete, Bully, Comrade, Forgiveness, Indigenous, Jailed, Militant, and President, to name a few. The book quotes liberally from Mandela himself, his ex-wives and other family members, global leaders, Mandela's cellmates and guards on Robben Island, the team behind Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, former president F. W. de Klerk, members of the South African Police, and his comrades including his successor Thabo Mbeki.  \n \nMadiba A to Z reveals sides of Nelson Mandela that are not often discussed and angles of the anti-apartheid movement that most choose to brush under the table in order to focus on the happy-ending version of the story. As Schechter reports in the book, according to Mandela's successor as president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, Ã¢â‚¬Å“the fundamental problems of South Africa, poverty, inequality, have remained unchanged since 1994.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This is partly because, as Schechter writes, Ã¢â‚¬Å“six months before the 1994 elections, when South Africa was being governed jointly by the ANC and the National Party under a Transitional Executive Council (TEC), there were secret negotiations about the economic future.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n \nThere are many rarely spoken of revelations in Madiba A to Z, a book about MandelaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliance, his courage, his tremendous impact in saving his country and its people of all races, but one that also shows how far South Africa still has to go.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://stat.homeshop18.com/homeshop18/images/coinjoos/773/300x300_b9a81604e9dfa35a9997c1f154232196.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://stat.homeshop18.com/homeshop18/images/coinjoos/773/300x300_b9a81604e9dfa35a9997c1f154232196.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAbout the Author :-\n\nDANNY SCHECHTER is an American journalist and a documentary filmmaker who made six non-fiction films with Mandela and who was asked personally by the filmmakers of LONG WALK TO FREEDOM to make a five-hour television documentary about the making of the forthcoming film.

They are best known as one of the most successful alternative bands operating out of Seattle during the years 1980 through 1987, leading up to the Seattle grunge explosion, and for their cult-classic song &quot;Vaporized&quot;.&quot;\n\nTRACK LIST:\nA1 Respite Lost\nA2 The Fog\nB1 Thats Life\nB2 Affliction\nB3 One Way\n\nCREDITS\nRecorded By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ric Wallace\n\nThe earlier band X-15 and the later 1986 EP credited the following members:\nKelly Mitchell - Vocals\nEric Alton - Guitar\nTodd Fuhs - Drums\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5d9d922acef461f46fa30f0e0a81a05f286f26e","amp;dn":"Life+In+General+-+Life+In+General+EP+%281982%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5d9d922acef461f46fa30f0e0a81a05f286f26e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,217,217,34,172,239,70,31,70,250,48,240,224,168,26,5,242,134,242,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

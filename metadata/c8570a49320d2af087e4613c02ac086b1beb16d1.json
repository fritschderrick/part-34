The first and last word on an underground roots music legend! Jim FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original album from 1969 has been described as the holy grail of country soul.\n\nJim Ford is Sly Stone's best friend and Nick Lowe's biggest musical influence. Aretha Franklin, Bobby Womack and The Temptations have all recorded his songs. But after one mythical album, 'Harlan County,' in 1969, he disappeared. Many\nhave tried to find him without success, but now Bear Family Records is proud to announce the definite collection plus the full story.\n\nComparisons? We have a few. 'Harlan County' inhabits the same territory as 'From Elvis In Memphis' or Dan Penn's 'Nobody's Fool,' and his record was every bit their equal. It occupies the land where R&amp;B meets country, Memphis and Nashville meet Louisiana, and the Mississippi Delta meets Appalachia. Jim Ford blended the ingredients in a way that had never, and would never, be done again.\n'The Sounds Of Our Time' is filled to the brim with breathtaking moments that are guaranteed to please any country soul fan.\n\n&quot;Jim Ford's songs made a tremendous impact on me. He's in the same musical league as Dan Penn, Spooner Oldham and Joe South. He's impossible to copy but the way he writes is something I've always aspired for. Jim Ford is the biggest musical influence of my life.&quot;Nick Lowe\n\n&quot;Jimmy Ford is the baddest white man on the planetÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Killer writer!!!&quot;\nSly Stone\n\n\nTracks:\n\n01.

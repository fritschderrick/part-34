Laura has \r\nbeen having the occasional vision for several years, which started this \r\nthematic work. These visions started as fleeting thoughts, which have now \r\nbecome full blown moving pictures, as if she were looking through a camera \r\nlens. These visions begin to haunt her as she can see people she knows in \r\nthese visions, they who end up being murdered by a knife through the eyes, \r\nthe actual murder which she &quot;sees&quot; as it is happening through the eyes of \r\nthe killer. As the police investigate these murders, she tries to explain \r\nto them her visions. The only one of the investigating detectives who \r\nbelieves her is the lead, Lieutenant John Neville. Laura is scared not only \r\nfor her friends and associates, but also herself as she can see in her \r\nvisions that the killer is also after her. As she begins a personal \r\nrelationship with Neville, she comes to the conclusion that the killer \r\nmay not be some random nut who solely dislikes her work, but someone that \r\nshe knows and trusts, the leading candidates being her estranged ex-husband, \r\nMichael Reisler, who recently re-entered her life, and her driver, Tommy \r\nLudlow, who routinely carries a knife and whose criminal past she had only \r\nrecently learned.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Faye Dunaway.\r\n=&gt;-Tommy Lee Jones.\r\n=&gt;-Brad Dourif.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Taylor Hackford.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Horror : Mystery : Thriller.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1978.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English : Italian.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.34 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 940 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 39mn.\r\n=&gt;-Eyes Of Laura Mars.........: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eyes_of_laura_mars/\r\n=&gt;-Eyes Of Laura Mars.........: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/eyes-of-laura-mars-1978/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 16:9.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 720 x 400.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 710 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 217 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio Italian.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 180 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English.\r\n=&gt;-Italian","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9722398933a7c27d5d8e426e7eaed0e371c6182d","amp;dn":"Eyes+Of+Laura+Mars+-+Faye+Dunaway+Mystery+1978+Eng+Ita+Multi-Sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9722398933a7c27d5d8e426e7eaed0e371c6182d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,34,57,137,51,167,194,125,93,142,66,110,126,174,208,227,113,198,24,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

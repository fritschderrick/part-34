The feds are setting up temporary shelters on military bases across America to house these children, and the Infowars crew took exclusive video and photos of the illegal alien shelter on Lackland Air Force Base despite all the measures taken by officials to keep media out. The Obama administration doesn't want the public to know that it treats illegal aliens far better than America's veterans. \n\nDan Bongino, an author and a former member of the Secret Service's Presidential Protection Division, joins the show to break down Obama's other numerous scandals. \n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien expert John Di Bartolo also joins the broadcast to share a lost audio recording of the Lord of the Rings author speaking out against government oppression and tyranny.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.

Knowing the cultural significance that the Chauvet Cave holds, the French government immediately cut-off all access to it, save a few archaeologists and paleontologists. But documentary filmmaker, Werner Herzog, has been given limited access, and now we get to go inside examining beautiful artwork created by our ancient ancestors around 32,000 years ago. He asks questions to various historians and scientists about what these humans would have been like and trying to build a bridge from the past to the present.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:087c12d047998a002732e7df1423a4cd78496b12","amp;dn":"Cave+of+Forgotten+Dreams+2010+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"087c12d047998a002732e7df1423a4cd78496b12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,124,18,208,71,153,138,0,39,50,231,223,20,35,164,205,120,73,107,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

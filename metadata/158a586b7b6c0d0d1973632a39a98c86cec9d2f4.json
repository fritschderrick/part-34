She then goes to class to find there's a new transfer student, Oogami Rei, who looks exactly like the boy she saw before and wears a black glove only on his left hand.\n\nOogami is a Code Breaker, one who &quot;does not exist&quot;. He is a seemingly cold-blooded killer who follows the principle of &quot;an eye for an eye&quot;, to &quot;use evil against evil&quot;.

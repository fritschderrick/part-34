It begins with his first MGM sessions,\nplus it includes all of the Snader Transcriptions, recordings for Decca, Liberty, Longhorne,\nKapp, and the final Liberty sessions in 1973. Disc 13 is an informal recording done at\nMerle Haggard's home in 1972. Though the hits from these years might have been a little more\nsporadic, they were just as good with such titles as &quot;Bubbles In My Beer,&quot; &quot;Blues For Dixie,&quot;\n&quot;Faded Love.&quot; &quot;Cadillac In Model A,&quot; &quot;My Shoes Keep Walking Back To You&quot; and &quot;Heart To Heart Talk.&quot;\nPlus favorites such as &quot;Dog House Blues,&quot; &quot;Cotton Patch Blues,&quot; &quot;Still Water Runs The Deepest,&quot;\n&quot;Ida Red Likes The Boogie,&quot; &quot;Mean Woman With The Green Eyes&quot; and &quot;'Tater Pie.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2366066a8b548e7018a4fc0210b9a798e55c0a5","amp;dn":"Bob+Wills+-+Faded+Love+%5B2005%5D+%28Bear+Family+Records+13+CD+Set%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2366066a8b548e7018a4fc0210b9a798e55c0a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,54,96,102,168,181,72,231,1,138,79,192,33,11,154,121,142,85,192,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

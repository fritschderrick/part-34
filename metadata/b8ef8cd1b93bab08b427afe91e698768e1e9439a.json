This exposure would eventually lead to work in 1971, as a deejay on the Prince Jackie and El Paso sound systems,[1] initially influenced by Big Youth, U Roy, and Dennis Alcapone,[1] and performing as &quot;Dennis Alcapone Jr.&quot;. The first record producer he worked with was Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, who decided that Bullock should change his name to Dillinger, after gangster John Dillinger.[2] He was part of the second wave of deejay toasters who rose to prominence during the mid-1970s. In 1974, he recorded &quot;Freshly&quot; for Yabby You, and 1975 saw a slew of releases with a variety of producers including Augustus Pablo (&quot;Brace a Boy&quot;), Joseph Hoo Kim (&quot;CB 200&quot;), and Coxsone Dodd (&quot;Killer Man Jaro&quot;).[1] Albums for Dodd (Ready Natty Dreadie) and Hoo Kim (CB 200 and Bionic Dread) would soon follow. His hit &quot;Cocaine In My Brain&quot;, which relied heavily on the main tune from &quot;Do It Any Way You Wanna&quot; by the People's Choice was hugely popular internationally, and was a number 1 hit in the Netherlands.[3] His output dropped somewhat in the mid-1980s but he returned to recording in the early 1990s.\n\n      Dillinger is known for his quick wit, humorous lyrics, and vulgar content (e.g. on the track &quot;Crabs in My Pants&quot;).\n\n      &quot;Cocaine In My Brain&quot; was featured on the K-Jah reggae radio station K-Jah West in the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNot every album but a good collection.

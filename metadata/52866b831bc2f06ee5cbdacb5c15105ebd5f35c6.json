I had tried to find one online, but to no avail. So instead I created my own, and I think I did a damn good job. I believe this to be the highest quality copy available, pre-synced or otherwise. Here are some of the things that make this special.\n\nThis version uses the second audio version; I find it to be better. I would have included both, but I have no idea how to do that. \n\n1: Snazzy main menu and scene selection (the background art is from the internet and I couldn't find the artist, otherwise I would credit them).\n\n2: Full 1080p rip of the video. \n\n3: Equalized audio between the first and second parts (the second was quite a bit    louder than the first).\n\n4: Flawless syncing of the entire movie. If you ever tried to do it yourself, you realize the second disc of audio doesn't quite match if you follow the directions exactly, so I did a bit of tweaking and I'm very pleased with it.\n\nI hope you all enjoy this as much as I do. I put quite a bit of effort into it! I'm sure I don't need to remind anyone to share this masterful work of art and comedy with your friends. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52866b831bc2f06ee5cbdacb5c15105ebd5f35c6","amp;dn":"Wizard+People%2C+Dear+Reader+Blu-Ray+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52866b831bc2f06ee5cbdacb5c15105ebd5f35c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,134,107,131,27,194,240,110,229,203,218,203,92,21,16,94,189,95,53,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

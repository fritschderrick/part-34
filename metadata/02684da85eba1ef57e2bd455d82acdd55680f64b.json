She \nmeets Bishop(Dwain Murphy) which is the dance crew leader. She then \nmeets Michelle and does a stomp battle with her. They become enemies \nthen friends later on. Her uptight mom pushes her to pass the test \nto get into Medical school, but she thinks she failed and will not \ngo. Michelle tells her about the Stomp Monster competition to win \nmoney to get into medical school. To pay for the tuition, she needs \nto join a dance crew to go to the Stomp Monster competition to win \n$50,000. She asks Bishop if she can join his stomp crew but the \nother crew members doubt her stomping skills. He gives her a spot \nin the crew and lets her rehearsal with them. When they stomp at \nfirst, they suck and seem to have bited off Fem Fatal\n(Michelle&amp;#039;s stomp crew). Bishop gets angry and kicks Raya out of the \ncrew. To apologize for making them look bad, she gives the money \nfrom the locket of her dead sister so that Bishop&amp;#039;s crew can go on \nto the stomp competition. At first Bishop rejects her, not the money, \nMichelle changes his mind and goes after Raya to tell her that she is \nin the crew again. The mother receives a letter from the medical \nschool and goes to find Raya at the Stomp Monster competition to tell\n her she passed the test and got a 92. On Day 2 of the stomp \ncompetition, they win the title and $50,000. \n\n\n\nSubtitles; Da,En,Nl,No,Fi,Sv,\n\nIMDb &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770810/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770810/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : How.She.Move.2007.MULTiSUBS.DVDRip.XviD-Cocc.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 700 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 24mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 165 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Streaming Video@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 24mn\nBit rate                         : 1 003 Kbps\nWidth                            : 624 pixels\nHeight                           : 336 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.857\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.191\nStream size                      : 602 MiB (86%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 24mn\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 149 Kbps\nMinimum bit rate                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 89.7 MiB (13%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 119 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.92 \nEncoding settings                : VBR (rh)\n\nCreated with: DP MediaInfo version 1.05 (c) by Dirk Paehl\nMediaInfoLib - v0.7.7.6\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02684da85eba1ef57e2bd455d82acdd55680f64b","amp;dn":"How.She.Move.2007.MULTiSUBS.DVDRip.XviD-Cocc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02684da85eba1ef57e2bd455d82acdd55680f64b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,104,77,168,94,186,30,245,126,43,212,85,216,42,205,213,86,128,246,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

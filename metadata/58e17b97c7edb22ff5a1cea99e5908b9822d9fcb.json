All the best new releases from old favourites such as Sigur Ros, The Cure, The Music and Beck (and that?s just the first four tracks). Check out the live tracks by Tricky and Portishead; the covers by The Dresden Dolls, The National and The Black Keys; new bands Flowers Forever, Zoey Van Goey and Dead Souls; old Peel favourites, the Wedding Present, Half Man Half Biscuit and Stereolab; and the last CD comprises of long songs that are so long they deserve a CD all of their own. \n\nGod bless Shankly.

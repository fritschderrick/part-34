He travels around the country as he explores the United Kingdom's remarkable past, from the perspective of ordinary people. It's wide-ranging, beautifully filmed and a bit sentimental, but also hugely informative and full of good humour. Nobody does this sort of thing better.\n\n\n\n\n6)  The Age of Revolution \nMichael Wood explores how civil war split Britain during the 17th century, beginning his journey in Dublin, where he examines artefacts of the 1641 Irish Rebellion, before travelling to Co Down to find out about the Ulster-Scots. Back in England, he explains how communities in the West Midlands were divided by the violent conflict between Parliament and the Crown, and visits a local history project that is unearthing evidence from a Cornish battlefield. He also charts the origins of revolutionary movements including the Levellers and Diggers, which he believes laid the foundations for modern British democracy.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img69/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img69/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img100/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img100/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img197/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img197/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img811/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img811/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img13/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img13/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img222/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img222/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img690/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img690/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img12/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img12/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1562 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Story:_A_People%27s_History_%28TV_series%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Story:_A_People%27s_History_%28TV_series%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cba1c17d8cc6dba9a01f99dc4c0b48ede8b0da68","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Great+British+Story+A+People+History+Season+1+6of8+The+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cba1c17d8cc6dba9a01f99dc4c0b48ede8b0da68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,161,193,125,140,198,219,169,160,31,153,220,76,11,72,237,232,176,218,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

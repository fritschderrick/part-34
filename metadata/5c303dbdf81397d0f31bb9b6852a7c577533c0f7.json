Each member of the bloodline has a star shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dio Brando, the original nemesis of the Joestar family, and his descendants have this distinguishable mark also, a result from Dio's 'theft' of Jonathan Joestar's body and inheriting the Joestar genes as well. The series spans several generations, with each part featuring a descendent of the Joestars as the main protagonist along with a large cast of characters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c303dbdf81397d0f31bb9b6852a7c577533c0f7","amp;dn":"%5Bgg%5D_Jojo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure_-_10_%5B33C5E6C0%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c303dbdf81397d0f31bb9b6852a7c577533c0f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,48,61,189,248,19,151,208,243,27,185,182,133,42,124,87,117,51,192,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

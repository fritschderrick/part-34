Their disembodied brains are hardly helpless, however, as they can remotely control all kinds of machines and craft through artificial interfaces.\n\nPlaying as one of these people's brains, you can quickly switch control between many different expendable bodies in order to complete otherwise dangerous tasks - all from the physical safety of your command bunker. Use these technological powers of telepathy to collect gold out of the fully destructible terrain, then purchase even more bodies and materiel with those newly acquired funds!\n\nYou can even program the crude A.I.s of your puppet army to complete simple tasks (patrolling, digging, etc.) while your attention and direct control is somewhere else. Use your accumulated forces to protect your brain, explore the world, and defeat your competition!\n\nTo find more information on this awesome game go here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.datarealms.com/games.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.datarealms.com/games.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTo download mods for this game go here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.datarealms.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=61&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.datarealms.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=61&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTo download scenes for this game go here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.datarealms.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=24&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.datarealms.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=24&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n*When you extract the folder, go into the folder and click on the .exe file to start the game (Optional you can create a shortcut for it to make it quicker to access), but if you get some type of message just click on 'OK' and it should load up.

Marcela&amp;#039;s powerful and crystalline vocals soar above the arrangements drawing the listener in right from the gentle opening tune &quot;eldalinalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«.&quot; The material is moody with dramatic textural and tempo shifts occurring multiple times within a track. Heavy guitar riffs compliment the gentler vocal and keyboard parts. Several stunning violin parts are featured... \n\nElfonia&amp;#039;s debut album is an album for female vocal enthusiasts regardless of their grounding. That the music is progressive with an occassional Latin and Celtic edge makes it even more exciting. The album can be obtained from the band&amp;#039;s website or at their live performances. One of the great finds as 2002 came a close, this 2003 debut album is worth a trans-Atlantic journey and is a must listen!\n\n\nOn the second album:\nThis music did remind me of Stream Of Passion because of MarcelaÃƒÂ¢??s vocals and some of the music; however, ElfonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a certainly makes an impression as an original band with their own unique style and sound. They combine a mix of prog-rock, jazz, and classical influences that creates, well, need I say it again-a sonic landscape. Ms. BovioÃƒÂ¢??s vocals are the kind that you find yourself enamored with immediately, she sings in Spanish and English throughout the recording and at times stretches out and sounds like an opera singer, her range and command is quite impressive.\n\nOn my favorite tracks is ÃƒÂ¢??CamaleÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³nÃƒÂ¢?? and it does not surprise me why it was, one the most respected and world renowned artist stands in to play guitar, Arjen Lucassen. It is one of the most powerful songs on the CD; featuring hard driving guitar lines backed by a solid backbeat from the rhythm section. They have some of their most spectacular moments of transition in the three-part suite ÃƒÂ¢??Gigantes.ÃƒÂ¢?? Each part is extensive and leads you into each progression with a balance of elements and subtle yet obvious nuances throughout your journey. This musical omnibus is comparative to taking several cans of paint and splashing it on a huge canvas, what you get when it is complete looks like a montage of bright colors spectacularly clashing with each other. In a musical sense, this process encourages creativity and exploration, which ultimately ends in the beauty of each individual composition. \n\nThe 70s Latin jazz fusion band Caldera came to mind a few times while listening to this music. They were one of the first bands I discovered while I was discovering jazz fusion in the early 80s. I can hear influences from bands like that in their sound. The most difficult thing for any band to do is to take that cornucopia of influence and come up with an original sound that has a recognizable stamp on it. They most definitely succeed in that process on this recording. Bovio is one of the most distinctive female vocalists I have heard in years and her contributions are extremely important to this bandÃƒÂ¢??s sound. I would not be surprised if she becomes an international star within the next few years. \n\nThis is a fantastic collection of recordings, the sound mix is superb and the musicianship excellent, what more can I say this is one great band. Even when Bovio sings a song in Spanish, and I do not understand a word, I love it. The music and her voice have this effect on you that you will have to experience for yourself to understand. As 2005 is ending, discovering ElfonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a has been one of the many joys I have had the privilege to hear coming through my speakers.

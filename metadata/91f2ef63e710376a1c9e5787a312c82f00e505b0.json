Comming from the streets of Portland, OR this group is on fire with the likes of DJ Chill and Pete Miser. Pete Miser has his own fresh style of lyrics, much of which will make you think and have you nodding your head in approval. DJ Chill is a master on the wax! The combination of the fresh vocals and beats will make this an excellent part of your Hip-Hop collection. Check out &quot;Posters&quot; &quot;You Jane Me Funky&quot; &quot;Whatchyassworth&quot;. From the best drummer in almost any genre of music added with some sweet horns...this album is sure to deliver!\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. The Audience is (Not) Listening (00:12), 0.52 MB\n02.

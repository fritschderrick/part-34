Combining recollections, accounts, and analysis, this book leans on Maw, Pap, Ony Mae, and other members of this rambunctious Scots-Irish family to chronicle the often heartbreaking postwar journey of 22 million rural Americans into the cities, where they became the foundation of a permanent white underclass. Telling the stories of the gun-owning, uninsured, underemployed white tribes inhabiting America's heartlands, this record offers an intimate look at what was lost in the orchestrated postwar shift from an agricultural to an urban consumer society.\n\npharmakate had uploaded this in pdf format but friends who 'needed' to read this had problems with pdf files on their readers.  So, I converted it into an EPub file and cleaned it all up using Sigil (I know, it takes forever to do it right but this book was worth it).\n\nSo, enjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8397446d937da95186ad77ce443a7fe787f8fca8","amp;dn":"Rainbow+Pie+-+A+Redneck+Memoir+-+Joe+Bageant.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8397446d937da95186ad77ce443a7fe787f8fca8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,151,68,109,147,125,169,81,134,173,119,206,68,58,127,231,135,248,252,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Joe emotionally blackmails Luke to guide them there, hoping to escape on the way. The usual route must shortened from 6 to 2 months, so no danger can be avoided. Given Lucky's reputation, Crook decides to shadow them to add sabotage, just to be sure- or is it?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2f8c6dd0a69b68d6986edfffa53f752934df8d2","amp;dn":"Go+West%21+A+Lucky+Luke+Adventure+%28English+Dubbed+DVDRip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2f8c6dd0a69b68d6986edfffa53f752934df8d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,248,198,221,10,105,182,141,105,134,237,255,250,83,247,82,147,77,248,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

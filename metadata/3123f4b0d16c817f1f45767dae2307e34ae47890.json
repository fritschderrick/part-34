Example: Being thrown out of the kitchen because oneâ€™s Easter bread kneading technique isnâ€™t up to par. As Adriana says: â€œWhen the Trigianis reach out and touch someone, we do it with food.â€ Like the recipes that have been handed down for generations from mother to daughter and grandmother to granddaughter, the familyâ€™s celebrations are also anchored to the life and laughter around the table. We learn how Grandmom Yolanda Trigiani sometimes wrote her recipes in code, or worked from memory, guarding her recipes carefully. And we meet Grandma Lucia Bonicelli, who never raised her voice and believed that when people fight at the dinner table, the food turns to poison in the body.\r\n\r\nAdriana Trigianiâ€™s voice springs to life from the first page of Cooking with My Sisters, a collection of beloved family recipes that the Trigianis have been enjoying for generations. But thereâ€™s much more here than just the food. Peppered with hilarious family anecdotes, poignant letters, and exquisite color photographs, Cooking with My Sisters draws us into the warm and witty world of the Trigiani clan. Each recipe has a story behind it, and each chapter has tips from different sisters, reflecting the unique personalities of the latest generation of Trigiani women.\r\n\r\nHere are mainstay meals, featured in sections such as â€œThe Big Lifeâ€ and â€œThe Big Wow,â€ which include the chapters â€œPasta, or as We Called It, Maccheroniâ€ and â€œFood We Hated as Kids but Love to Serve Now.â€ Accessible to any cook, the recipes range from Chicken and Polenta, Zizi Maryâ€™s Rice Soup, and Gnocchi to favorite desserts like Grandmomâ€™s Buttermilk Cakeâ€“and all the delectable dishes are geared toward bringing your family together.\r\n\r\nWritten with Adriana Trigianiâ€™s trademark humor and verve, this wonderful book will appeal to anyone who values the bonds that food, community, and cultural tradition can provide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3123f4b0d16c817f1f45767dae2307e34ae47890","amp;dn":"Cooking+with+My+Sisters+%282004%29+%28Pdf%2C+Epub+and+Mobi%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3123f4b0d16c817f1f45767dae2307e34ae47890","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,35,244,176,209,108,129,127,31,69,118,125,174,35,7,227,74,228,120,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The first section alleges that the global economic system disadvantages and exploits the poor; the second section refutes the first, asserting that globalization has the potential to empower and enrich the poor. The third section examines the role governments and international organizations play in globalizations effects on the poor. The final quarter of the book is a case study of the East Asian Crisis: how international organizations and governments responded to the crisis and how their policies affected the poor.

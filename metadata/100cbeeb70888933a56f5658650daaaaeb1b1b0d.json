Reid Gower is the publisher of the 9-part series, and C.J. Sutherland is the creator of the series that is now approaching close to 30 episodes. You can look them up on youtube or social media if you would like.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuality: 720p [HD]  ...[Direct d/l via YouTube]\nFormat: .Mp4\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy.

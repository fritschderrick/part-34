The formulas are mostly applicable in financial and actuarial practice. Their mathematical level ranges from simple ones based on arithmetic to very sophisticated matters of higher mathematics (e. g.stochastic calculus), but they are usually presented in the form most frequently used in applications. Explanations and references to related parts of the survey are given so that one can easily browse and look them up in the text; the detailed Index is also helpful for this purpose. The survey will be of benefit for students, researchers and practitioners in financeand insurance.

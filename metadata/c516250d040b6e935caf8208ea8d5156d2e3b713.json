It is an acerbic satirical book which was completely ahead of its time and that still can shock and amuse all kind of readers today. Give it a try if you are interested in forgotten classics that deserve to be better known.\n\nFirst published in 1873. EPUB format. Thanks a lot to the original uploaders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c516250d040b6e935caf8208ea8d5156d2e3b713","amp;dn":"AMBROSE+BIERCE+-+The+Fiend%27s+Delight+%281873%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c516250d040b6e935caf8208ea8d5156d2e3b713","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,22,37,13,4,11,110,147,92,175,130,8,234,141,81,86,210,227,183,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

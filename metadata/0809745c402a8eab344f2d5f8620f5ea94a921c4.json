On the edge of the dish, a sharp metallic edge on which no bird would have dared to perch, three completely naked men were sitting, with their faces turend up to the midday sun; no one saw them, of course.&quot;\n\n\nGhosts revolves around an immigrant worker's family squatting on the haunted construction site on a luxury condominium building. All the workmen and their wives and children see the ghosts, who literally hang around the place, but one teenage girl becomes the most curious. Her questions about the ghosts get so intense that her mother -- in a chilling split-second -- realizes her daughter's life hangs in the balance.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0809745c402a8eab344f2d5f8620f5ea94a921c4","amp;dn":"Ghosts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0809745c402a8eab344f2d5f8620f5ea94a921c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,9,116,92,64,42,142,171,52,79,45,95,134,32,245,234,148,169,33,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

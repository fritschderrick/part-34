But there&amp;#039;s a \nwrinkle in her plan when her beloved, Captain Dobi, stumbles on her bloody \nsecret-and she finally learns that a little mass murder really can suck the \nromance out of your love life!\n\nTRIVIA:\n\n    * Ingrid Pitt&amp;#039;s voice was dubbed. Supposedly, she was so furious at \ndirector Peter Sasdy that she vowed never to speak to him again.\n\n    * Countess Dracula was based on Hungarian Countess Erzsebet (our modern day \n&quot;Elizabeth&quot;) Bathory who lived from 1560 to 1614. Countess Bathory was allegedly \nresponsible for the deaths of approximately 600 virgin girls, all of which \ninvolved torture and gruesome methods of killing. Her atrocities are mostly \nspeculation. She is credited for influencing our modern day concept of Dracula \nas an entity depending on human blood for youth and vitality.\n\n    * The picture that appears behind the opening credits is an 1896 painting by \nHungarian artist Istvan Csok. It shows the real Countess Bathory enjoying the \ntorture of some young women by her servants. In an inner courtyard of one of her \ncastles, the naked girls are being drenched with water and allowed to freeze to \ndeath in the snow.\n\n    * Ingrid Pitt replaced Diana Rigg who turned the role down.\n\n    * Although cuts were requested by the BBFC (and the film remains listed as \ncut on their website) the edits were never made following an appeal by Hammer to \nchief censor Stephen Murphy.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e9173984220e1d8d51e735aa3f3006676ccd7a7","amp;dn":"Countess+Dracula+%28Peter+Sasdy%2C+1971%29+%28Dual%29+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e9173984220e1d8d51e735aa3f3006676ccd7a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,145,115,152,66,32,225,216,213,30,115,90,163,243,0,102,118,204,215,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

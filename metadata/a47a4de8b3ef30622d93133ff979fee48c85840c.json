Following the Rebug 4.46 , Rogero 4.55, and FERROX's 3.55 / 4.55 varieties that were recently patched. We now have a patched HABIB 4.55. However this was originally a Cobra CFW but that has been removed by furtsiv who has also applied this patch. Most likely removed due to issue from the patch. So stay tuned as we are sure to see some more CFW varties with this recent patch released","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a47a4de8b3ef30622d93133ff979fee48c85840c","amp;dn":"%5BPS3%5D+4.55_habib_1.03_nobd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a47a4de8b3ef30622d93133ff979fee48c85840c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,122,77,232,179,239,48,98,45,147,19,63,249,121,254,228,140,133,132,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

When Playboys Ruled the World examines the close relationship between the twoworld champions who, despite their different disciplines and backgrounds, became like brothers.\n\nF1 star Hunt, who won the 1976 world championship, and Sheene, who claimed motorcycling world title glory that same year and the next, were crowd favourites and national heroes. As famous for the party lifestyle they led away from the track as their achievements on it, they embraced the playboy tag given to them.\n\nWhen Playboys Ruled the World contrasts public and media attitudes towards the private lives of Sheene and Hunt in comparison with the heavily-scrutinised lifestyles of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s multi-million pound sports stars.\n\nProduced by the team behind ITV SportÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Grierson-nominated documentary Clough, When Playboys Ruled the World mixes original interviews with Hunt and Sheene with exceptional archive footage and new opinion from friends, family members and industry experts. Contributors include BarryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s widow Stephanie Sheene, JamesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ brother David Hunt, Sir Stirling Moss, Max Mosley, Murray Walker, Max Clifford and Kelvin MacKenzie.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJames Hunt and Barry Sheene were the last of a generation whose lifestyles, as much as their huge success on the track, made them sporting heroes,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ remarked ITV Controller of Sport, Niall Sloane. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis new documentary tells the fascinating story of two ofgreatest motorsport champions, and looks at a way of life and a friendship which probably would not exist in the modern sporting and media world.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nWhen Playboys Ruled the World is an ITV Sport production and will be broad\ncast on ITV1 tonight (Monday) at 10:30pm.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3cca5b7b9c5db73c5faa9f1009bcd9ef8762e68","amp;dn":"Hunt+and+Sheene+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+When+Playboys+Ruled+the+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3cca5b7b9c5db73c5faa9f1009bcd9ef8762e68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,204,165,183,185,197,219,115,197,250,169,241,0,155,205,158,248,118,46,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

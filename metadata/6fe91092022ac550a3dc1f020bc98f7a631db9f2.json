I'm Casey Kasem and the countdown continues with Peaches &amp; Herb at number twenty-one, moving up three, 'Shake Your Groove Thing'.&quot; \n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nThis is the last countdown before AT40 began recapping Last Week's Top 3. Notice it has four in-show Extras, as well as the three Archive specials and two Long-Distance Dedications. The following week's show would have only one LDD and no Extras.\n\nFor the first time in chart history it can be said that three songs have hit the top 10, all sharing the same title. The first act to do it was The Crazy World of Arthur Brown in 1968, the second was The Ohio Players in 1975, and the third is in this week's top five.\n\nA listener asks, &quot;Who is the oldest person ever to have a top 40 hit?&quot; Casey recalls several people who were over 60 when they hit the chart but says the oldest was 73.\n\nA man writes in to correct Casey, who had previously credited Donna Summer's boyfriend Bruce Sudano as singing backup on &quot;Heaven Knows&quot; (at number 15). Her real backup was Brooklyn Dreams and the parents of one of its members write in to say Bruce didn't sing on that one.\n\nPoco has their first top 40 hit &quot;Crazy Love&quot; (at number 31), as does Cheryl Lynn (at number 12) with &quot;Got To Be Real&quot;. \n\nCasey plays an Extra by the only person ever to have been on four number one records before he was 13-years-old, and tells why Paul Anka wrote a song about being a two-timing man.\n\n40: You Make Me Feel Mighty Real - Sylvester\n39: Forever In Blue Jeans - Neil Diamond\n38: Song On The Radio - Al Stewart\n37: You Can Do It - Dobie Gray\n36: Stormy - Santana\n35: New York Groove - Ace Frehley\n34: Haven't Stopped Dancing Yet - Gonzalez\n33: Sultans Of Swing - Dire Straits\nEXTRA: Love Child - The Supremes\n32: My Life - Billy Joel\n31: Crazy Love - Poco\nARCHIVES: Brandy - Looking Glass\n30: I Just Fall In Love Again - Anne Murray\n29: Take Me To The River - The Talking Heads\n28: What You Won't Do For Love - Bobby Caldwell\nLDD: California Nights - Leslie Gore\n27: What A Fool Believes - The Doobie Brothers\n26: Lady - Little River Band\n25: Baby I'm Burnin' - Dolly Parton\n24: Every Time I Think Of You - The Babys\n23: Too Much Heaven - The Bee Gees\n22: Dancin' Shows - Nigel Olsson\nEXTRA: Got To Be There - Michael Jackson\n21: Shake Your Groove Thing - Peaches &amp; Herb\nARCHIVES: Black And White - Three Dog Night\n20: Don't Cry Out Loud - Melissa Manchester\n19: Tragedy - The Bee Gees\n18: The Gambler - Kenny Rogers\nEXTRA: One Man Woman, One Woman Man - Paul Anka &amp; Odia Coates\n17: Blue Morning, Blue Day - Foreigner\n16: No Tell Lover - Chicago\n15: Heaven Knows - Donna Summer W/ Brooklyn Dreams\n14: Soul Man - The Blues Brothers\n13: Shake It - Ian Matthews\n12: Got To Be Real - Cheryl Lynn\n11: September - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\nARCHIVES: Baby, Don't Get Hooked On Me - Mac Davis\n10: I Was Made For Dancing - Leif Garrett\n9: Somewhere In The Night - Barry Manilow\n8: Lotta Love - Nicolette Larson\nLDD: Someday We'll Be Together - The Supremes\n7: Le Freak - Chic\n6: Everyone's A Winner - Hot Chocolate\n5: I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor\n4: Fire - The Pointer Sisters\n3: A Little More Love - Olivia Newton-John\nEXTRA: Devil Woman - Cliff Richard\n2: Y.M.C.A. - The Village People\n1: Do Ya Think I'm Sexy - Rod Stewart","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fe91092022ac550a3dc1f020bc98f7a631db9f2","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1979_February_17th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fe91092022ac550a3dc1f020bc98f7a631db9f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,233,16,146,2,42,197,80,163,220,31,2,11,201,143,122,99,29,185,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

These institutions share a common ideology. They aggressively promote &quot;corporate&quot; capitalism, neoliberalism, giving free rein to the interests of a small number of transnational corporations. This book presents the history and fundamental ideas of this economic ideology. Describing each member of the &quot;unholy trinity,&quot; it shows how neoliberalism hijacked the IMF, World Bank and WTO in relation to their global financial, development and trade management roles.\n\nPublisher: Zed Books (November 29, 2003)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 184277073X\nISBN-13: 978-1842770733","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f22eb745d0486e79258434b202cd74f33f2661f7","amp;dn":"Richard_Peet-Unholy_Trinity__The_IMF%2C_World_Bank_and_WTO%2C_Second","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f22eb745d0486e79258434b202cd74f33f2661f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,46,183,69,208,72,110,121,37,132,52,178,2,205,116,243,63,38,97,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

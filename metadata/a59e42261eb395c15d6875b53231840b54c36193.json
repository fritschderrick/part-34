It's Professor Solomon's guide to UFOs - specifically, his comprehensive study of the flying saucer phenomenon. In this scholarly yet entertaining work, the Professor delves into UFO legend and lore particularly that of the contactees of the 1950s.\n\nHe also presents a biography of George Adamski, the most controversial (and colorful) of the contactees. And he offers practical advice for readers about to embark on their own flying saucer experience. Read this book and be ready for your ride in a UFO.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Make-Most-Flying-Saucer-Experience/dp/0912509074/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370883717&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=flying+saucer+experience&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Make-Most-Flying-Saucer-Experience/dp/0912509074/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370883717&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=flying+saucer+experience&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a59e42261eb395c15d6875b53231840b54c36193","amp;dn":"How+to+Make+the+Most+of+a+Flying+Saucer+Experience","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a59e42261eb395c15d6875b53231840b54c36193","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,158,66,38,30,179,149,193,93,104,117,181,50,49,132,11,84,195,97,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

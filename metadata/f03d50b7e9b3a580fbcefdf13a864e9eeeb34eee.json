Originally a rockabilly artist, he wrote the songs &quot;Bad Case of Loving You (Doctor, Doctor)&quot;, made famous by the English singer Robert Palmer, and &quot;Cadillac Walk&quot;, made famous by the American singer Willy DeVille.\n\nMartin scored two minor hits of his own with &quot;Rolene&quot; (#30 Billboard Hot 100) and &quot;No Chance&quot; (#50), both in 1979. His 1982 song, &quot;X-Ray Vision&quot; was an MTV hit music video.\n\nHe was given the nickname &quot;Moon&quot; because many of his songs had the word &quot;moon&quot; in the lyrics.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f03d50b7e9b3a580fbcefdf13a864e9eeeb34eee","amp;dn":"Moon+Martin+-+The+Very+Best+Of+%5B1999%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f03d50b7e9b3a580fbcefdf13a864e9eeeb34eee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,61,80,183,233,179,165,128,251,206,253,241,58,134,78,158,238,179,78,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

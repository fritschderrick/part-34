No other animals love us in quite the same way as dogs love us. And it is mutual. Is it possible that we developed our capacity for love, sympathy, empathy, and compassion because of our long association with dogs?\n\nIn The Dog Who CouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Stop Loving, Masson considers the far-reaching consequences of the coevolution of dogs and humans, drawing upon recent scientific research. Over the past forty thousand years a collective domestication has occurred that brings us to where we are todayÃ¢â‚¬â€humans have formed intense bonds with dogs, and the adoration is almost always reciprocal. Masson himself has experienced a profound bond with his new dog, Benjy, a failed guide dog for the blind, who possesses an abundance of uninhibited love. Masson knows that the love he feels for BenjyÃ¢â‚¬â€the same feeling Benjy has for all the people and animals around himÃ¢â‚¬â€is not unique, but exemplifies a love affair unmatched in the animal world.\n\nWith wisdom, insight, and a brilliant analysis of recent scientific findings, bestselling author Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson delivers a provocative and compelling book that will change the way we think about love and our canine companions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91620da297afc31f274fc6207bc48fed46d5303e","amp;dn":"The+Dog+Who+Couldn%27t+Stop+Loving+%5BEPUB%2FPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91620da297afc31f274fc6207bc48fed46d5303e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,98,13,162,151,175,195,31,39,79,198,32,123,196,143,237,70,213,48,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Spigot is that &quot;special sauce&quot; used by many of the world's top Minecraft servers to ensure that they can cope with their huge player base and ensure the satisfaction of their players. Spigot works by reducing and eliminating many causes of lag, as well as adding in handy features and settings that help make your job of server administration easier. The end result is your server becomes a cut above the competition, and you no longer have to spend time tearing your hair out over players complaining of lag. It must also be added that Spigot is perfect for smaller servers too, especially due to features like cutting idle CPU usage, saving power and other resources when only a few or no players are online.\n\nThis Version of Spigot was released on 09-09-2014 and is Version b","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3810b553b792215a7440b43e14891e6d1992a90","amp;dn":"Minecraft+Spigot+-+09-09-2014+Version-b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3810b553b792215a7440b43e14891e6d1992a90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,129,11,85,59,121,34,21,167,68,11,67,225,72,145,230,209,153,42,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

I was hooked and I hope some of you will be too. Unfortunately that first encode had excessive bit-rate and I had major difficulties encoding this properly. If I had not seen it already I probably would have just given up and moved on.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img228.imageshack.us/img228/7348/cover005.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img228.imageshack.us/img228/7348/cover005.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOriental Elegy (1996). Visually impressionistic, atmospherically dense, and narratively opaque, Oriental Elegy is the surreal journey of a displaced spirit (Aleksandr Sokurov) as he wanders in the interminable darkness through the temporal landscape of a quaint and isolated feudal-era fishing village. Guided by a series of faintly illuminated rooms, the wandering spirit comes upon ancient souls who take on physical forms as they recount their personal stories of daily existence, loss, and tragedy in the peasant community. Intrigued by his initial visit to a curiously distracted elderly woman, the spirit returns to her home in order to ask a fundamental question - &quot;What is happiness?&quot; - an existential query that is innocently answered with innate humility and accepted unknowingness. Through abstractly textured imagery and indelibly hypnotic dreamscapes, Sokurov composes a metaphoric, sensual, and evocative tone poem on a soul's search for enlightenment and the essential survival of human consciousness.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/Clipboard01-36.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/Clipboard01-36.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/Clipboard02-36.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/Clipboard02-36.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/Clipboard03-36.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/Clipboard03-36.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/Clipboard04-28.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/Clipboard04-28.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/Clipboard05-26.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af169/kashmir_kittie/Clipboard05-26.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------my rip----------\n\nThis is the &quot;Russian Version&quot; of the film. I have no idea if there is a &quot;Japanese Version&quot;. To nitpick, the film is technically shot in Japanese and has a Russian voice-over narration by the director. There were a couple of places where the two voices were competing for my ear and annoying yet I believe this is the effect meant by the director. At any rate, any &quot;Japanese Version&quot; would require substantial Japanese narration beyond the spoken lines to equal the Russian narration.\n\n~~~~~~ Vostochnaya elegiya.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................737,777,664                     \n                                                                               \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \n\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................44:34.400                \nFrame Count:....................................66860             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................480                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.333                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1973                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.257&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................224                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2    \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.

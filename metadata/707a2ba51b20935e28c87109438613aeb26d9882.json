Plenty of topical and amazing gags, several arguments about football, some fairly merciless banter, a chat about all the funny and crazy things you've seen and done that week Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and of course, a frank discussion about the beauty and general awesomeness of women. Fortunately, such a magazine exists. ZOO, the world's best selling men's weekly magazine, is all about the things that bring men together Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all those things that we are proud to say make us normal blokes. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:707a2ba51b20935e28c87109438613aeb26d9882","amp;dn":"ZOO+Issue+509+-+January+6+2014++UK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"707a2ba51b20935e28c87109438613aeb26d9882","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,122,43,165,27,32,147,94,40,200,113,9,67,134,19,174,178,109,152,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

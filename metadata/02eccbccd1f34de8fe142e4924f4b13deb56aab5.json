One track has 10,000 Days, while the other has Viginti Tres followed by Wings for Mary. \n\nThe reason for this is that Viginiti Tres is 5:02 and Wings for Mary is 6:11, which add up to 11:14 (10,000 Days time as well). If the songs are perfectly arranged, a mix of harmony will surface from the music. Even though some parts seem to mismatch, it is all played with a constant rhythm.\n\nTorrent by Abuela666","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02eccbccd1f34de8fe142e4924f4b13deb56aab5","amp;dn":"Tool+-+10000+Days+Hidden+Track+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02eccbccd1f34de8fe142e4924f4b13deb56aab5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,236,203,204,209,243,77,232,254,20,46,73,36,244,177,61,235,86,170,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

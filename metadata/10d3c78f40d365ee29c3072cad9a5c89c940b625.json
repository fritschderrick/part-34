Their first single as the Who, &quot;I Can't Explain&quot;, reached the UK top ten, followed by a string of singles including &quot;My Generation&quot;, &quot;Substitute&quot; and &quot;Happy Jack&quot;. In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released the US top ten single &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot;, while touring extensively. The group's fourth album, 1969's rock opera Tommy, included the single &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; and was a critical and commercial success. Live appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight Festival, along with the live album Live at Leeds, cemented their reputation as a respected rock act. With their success came increased pressure on lead songwriter and visionary Townshend, and the follow-up to Tommy, Lifehouse, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up 1971's Who's Next, which included the hit &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;. The group released the album Quadrophenia in 1973 as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of Tommy in 1975. They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of Who Are You in 1978 was overshadowed by the death of Moon shortly after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtists:...............-The Who\r\nAlbum Name:............-The Singles 1967-1973\r\nFormat:................-Mp3,\r\nBitrate:...............-320\r\nGenre:.................-Rock, Power Pop\r\nSize:..................-254MB\r\nTracks:................-CD 1 (16) , CD 2 (16)\r\n CD 1\r\n1.

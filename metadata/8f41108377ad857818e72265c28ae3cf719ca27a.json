The world is divided into three countries that include the entire globe: Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia. Oceania is a totalitarian society led by Big Brother, which censors everyoneÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s behavior, even their thoughts. Winston is disgusted with his oppressed life and secretly longs to join the fabled Brotherhood, a supposed group of underground rebels intent on overthrowing the government. Winston meets Julia and they secretly fall in love and have an affair, something which is considered a crime. One day, while walking home, Winston encounters O&amp;#039;Brien, an inner party member, who gives Winston his address. Winston had exchanged glances with O&amp;#039;Brien before and had dreams about him giving him the impression that O&amp;#039;Brien was a member of the Brotherhood. Since Julia hated the party as much as Winston did, they went to O&amp;#039;BrienÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s house together where they were introduced into the Brotherhood. O&amp;#039;Brien is actually a faithful member of the Inner-Party and this is actually a trap for Winston, a trap that O&amp;#039;Brien has been cleverly setting for seven years. Winston and Julia are sent to the Ministry of Love which is a sort of rehabilitation center for criminals accused of thoughtcrime. There, Winston was separated from Julia, and tortured until his beliefs coincided with those of the Party. Winston denounces everything he believed him, even his love for Julia, and was released back into the public where he wastes his days at the Chestnut Tree drinking gin.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f41108377ad857818e72265c28ae3cf719ca27a","amp;dn":"1984+%28e-book%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f41108377ad857818e72265c28ae3cf719ca27a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,65,16,131,119,173,133,120,24,231,34,101,194,138,227,207,113,156,162,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

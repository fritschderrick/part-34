Bassist Masi Stalder started The Band. Together with Adrian Pflugshaup(sax) and Chris Niederer (drums) they have released five EPs and distributed them on their own.\n\nIn 2006 the German label with cult status ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Echo BeachÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ(Dub Syndicate, Tackhead, King Tubby...) signed DUB SPENCER &amp; TRANCE HILL and released their first album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾NitroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ which received critical acclaim. The influential German Reggae magazine ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾RiddimÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ voted ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾NitroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Dub Album of the monthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ.\n\n2007 Adrian and Chris got lost somewhere between backstage rooms, dangerous side streets and backyards. DS &amp; TH was reformed as a quartet (Markus Meier - guitar, Philipp Greter - keys, Julian Dillier - drums and Masi Stalder - bass). But nobody wants to lament the old formation. The Dub Spencer &amp; Trance Hill groove became more stable. On ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Return Of The SupercopsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ they have delved into the essence of Dub more than ever before and let it burn at the same time! \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:749692bc6b88e764a5edbac483ce55ddebffb6b7","amp;dn":"Dub+Spencer+Trance+Hill+-+Return+Of+The+Supercops+%5B2007%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"749692bc6b88e764a5edbac483ce55ddebffb6b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,150,146,188,107,136,231,100,165,237,186,196,131,206,85,221,235,255,182,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

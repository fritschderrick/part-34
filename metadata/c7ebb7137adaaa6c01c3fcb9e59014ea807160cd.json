Right now, he set it in place along with a Wine wrapper for the game client. Although the client works for now, keep in mind that it can break every patch! This is why we suggest to play one or two custom games before starting to play any match made game after the deploy of a patch.\n\nThe iLoL client makes use of the Wine technology. Be aware that your performances might drop compared to the old Riot Mac client and the Boompje Edition.\n\nWe also want you to notice that this project is in no way affiliated with Riot Games Inc.

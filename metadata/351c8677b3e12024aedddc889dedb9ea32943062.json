Part 2 covers Ã¢â‚¬Ëœgame theory applicationsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and encompasses the process of forming a coalition within a corporate network to the problem of integrating inventory and distribution optimization together with game theory to effectively manage supply networks.\n\nProviding a forum to investigate, exchange novel ideas and disseminate knowledge covering the broad area of multi-criteria and game theory applications in manufacturing and logistics, Applications of Multi-Criteria and Game Theory Approaches is an excellent reference for students, researchers, and managers and industry professionals working with manufacturing and logistics issues.\n\nContent Level Ã‚Â» Research\n\n\nAUTHORS &amp; EDITORS\nProf. Lyes Benyoucef received the Ph.D degree in Operations Research from the National Polytechnic Institute of Grenoble, France in 2000 and the Habilitation ÃƒÂ  Diriger des Recherches degree from University of Metz, France in 2008. Since September 2011, he is full professor at Aix-Marseille University. Before joining Aix-Marseille University, he was a senior researcher at INRA (The French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control). His research interests include modeling, performance evaluation, simulation and optimization of supply chains and E-sourcing technologies. He is author/co-author of over 85 publications including over 25 articles in leading scientific journals of related fields, 8 book chapters and 52 articles in international conferences. Prof. Benyoucef has rich industrial application experiences within European industries. He is involved in the European projects GROWTH-ONE (Optimization methodologies for Networked Enterprises) for the strategic design of supply chain networks, GROWTH thematic network TNEE on extended enterprises, French-German GrailChem (Green Rail Freight for Chemical Goods) and FP6-NoE I*PROMS on innovation and intelligent machines, and production systems.\n\nDr. Jean-Claude Hennet is a Research Director of the French Research Centre (CNRS). He graduated from the Ecole Nationale SupÃƒÂ©rieure de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢AÃƒÂ©ronautique et de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Espace, Toulouse, France in 1974, received a MS degree in Industrial Engineering from Stanford University, California (1975), a Docteur-IngÃƒÂ©nieur degree from INSA-Toulouse in 1978 and a degree of Docteur dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©tat from University Paul Sabatier, Toulouse in 1982. He is currently the head of the CNRS Aix-Marseilles Research Federation of Informatics and Interactions (FRIIAM) and of the research team on Knowledge, Decision and Monitoring at LSIS, Marseilles, France. He is the author or co-author of more than 130 articles, including 37 articles in leading scientific journals, 12 book chapters and 76 articles in international conferences. His research interests are in the field of systems theory, optimization, game theory, control under constraints, discrete event decision systems and manufacturing systems.\n\n Prof. Manoj Kumar Tiwari is working in the area of Computational Intelligence and its application in Manufacturing and Operations Management. His contribution has also been focused to solve the production planning and control problems of manufacturing. Issues and concerns related to Supply Chain Management have also been taken care of by Prof. M.K. Tiwari. He has published more than 187 papers in international journals of repute and more than 90 paper is several national and international conferences. He is listed among the top 20 Most Productive Authors in the area of Production and operations management as reported in the last 50 years (Published in a survey article in Int. Journal of Production Economics 2009, 12, 540-551) and rated 2nd among many researchers working in Logistics and Supply Chain Management in India (Analysis of the logistics Research in India-White paper published in TU Dortmund University, Dortmund Germany-2012). He is serving as Associate Editors of IEEE System, Man and Cybernetics, Part A, (SMCA), International Journal of Production research (Taylor and Francis), Computer and Industrial Engineering (Elsevier), International Journal of System Science (Taylor and Francis) and Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing (Springer) and Neuro-computing (Elsevier). Prof. Tiwari is in the editorial board of several international journals such as EJOR, IJPR, IJCIM, PPC, RCIM, IMechE, Part C, IJAMT, JTS, etc. Prof. Tiwari is well known for grooming Under Graduate and Post Graduate students to carry out research and build up their career through research route. Several students of Prof. Tiwari are working as faculty members in different Universities of UK and US and also in very good companies of world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:351c8677b3e12024aedddc889dedb9ea32943062","amp;dn":"Applications+of+Multi-Criteria+and+Game+Theory+Approaches%3A+Manuf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"351c8677b3e12024aedddc889dedb9ea32943062","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,28,134,119,179,225,32,36,174,221,220,136,157,237,185,234,50,148,48,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

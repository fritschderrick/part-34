A guy with a reputation that rivals her own and an uncanny ability to invoke feelings in her sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never had before. He terrifies her and captivates her all in the span of just one encounter, and something about the way he makes her feel sparks buried memories from a past that she wishes could just stay buried.\n\nSky struggles to keep him at a distance knowing heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing but trouble, but Holder insists on learning everything about her. After finally caving to his unwavering pursuit, Sky soon finds that Holder isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t at all who heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been claiming to be. When the secrets heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been keeping are finally revealed, every single facet of SkyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life will change forever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5db46de64ffebe414b63cbc20469f8e9d02492f3","amp;dn":"colleen-hoover-hopeless","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5db46de64ffebe414b63cbc20469f8e9d02492f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,180,109,230,79,254,190,65,75,99,203,194,4,105,248,233,208,36,146,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

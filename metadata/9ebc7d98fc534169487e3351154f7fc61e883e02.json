However, a computer cannot, on its own, control the way in which it is used. However, this may be necessary to prevent problems, as when employees download pirated software from the web, or when students use a school computer for unintended purposes, or trade show attendees change the settings on a public computer. Our software is designed for small and medium-size companies, schools, public agencies, and, of course, also for individuals who are interested in protecting their computer.\n\nFeatures:\n\nImproved software filter\nFor any application, establish whether it is always available, never available, or restricted by time. User Control shows both the application name and the name of the executable file. An application can be made available only at specified times.\n\nControlling window titles\nYou can set restrictions not only for individual applications, but also for specified window titles. Window titles can be blocked system-wide or for individual applications.\n\nDesktop Protection\nTo prevent changes to a desktop once it has been set up, you can lock in its appearance. This means that you can stop individual icons from being moved, deleted, or renamed. You can also prevent hiding of the start menu or the taskbar.\n\nInternet Safety\nUse filter categories, such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“sexÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“chatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to determine the types of web content you would like to allow or prohibit. You can also prevent downloading of .exe and .zip files.\n\nSay yes to the web, but...\nDefine which web pages (URL's) or keywords you don't want to see on your computer. Users who surf to one of these pages will see a warning message displayed. You can also import or export lists of restrictions.\n\nProtecting the Start Menu, Desktop and more\nYou can restrict access to a large number of Windows system settings. For example, you can prevent the display of individual items on the start menu, restrict access to Control Panel, prevent logging off or shutting down, and much more.\n\nKiosk mode for public PC\nUse the Kiosk mode for any of your public PCs. Start a defined program or a defined website. For websites you can use the User Control Internet browser. This special browser displays your website without any fancy functions. Just your page. And nothing else.\n\nSupported OS:\n\nWindows All\n\nHomepage: http://salfeld.com//software/usercontrol/index.html\n\nInstallation Instructions: \n\n- Install program.\n- Register application with any name and given key.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ebc7d98fc534169487e3351154f7fc61e883e02","amp;dn":"Salfeld+User+Control+2014+v14.626+WinALL+with+Key+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ebc7d98fc534169487e3351154f7fc61e883e02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,188,125,152,252,83,65,105,72,126,51,81,21,79,127,198,30,136,62,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

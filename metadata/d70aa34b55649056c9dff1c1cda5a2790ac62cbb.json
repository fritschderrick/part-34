The band include guitars, upright bass, Hammond &amp; piano, drums and mandolin and it all comes together into an album with a classic North American feel.\nThe songs have a loose theme of the impact of urbanisation on people and the impact this can have on individuals and communities - there are a number of songs that touch on this including the powerful ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Before the Morning SunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Ashen TownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (a memorable co-write with Francey), and the final track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Sorry for the CityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is a thought-provoking piece of songwriting.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re all LeavingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is a perfectly balanced album, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a packed full of thoughtful and thought-provoking songs, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s equally full of hooks and varied instrumentation that give the songs an immediacy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ this is an album that gives back to the listener in many ways.  Unreservedly recommended.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp \n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/10/26/dave-gunning/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d70aa34b55649056c9dff1c1cda5a2790ac62cbb","amp;dn":"Dave+Gunning...We%5C%27re+All+Leaving%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d70aa34b55649056c9dff1c1cda5a2790ac62cbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,10,163,75,85,100,144,86,201,223,241,193,205,165,162,121,10,198,44,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

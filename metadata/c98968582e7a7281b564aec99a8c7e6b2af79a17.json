HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hanging loose.\n \nEve Monroe is a stock-car PR pro who puts her career firstÃ¢â‚¬â€until an on-track wardrobe malfunction reveals more than the sexy smile of jackman Nolan Ford. The videoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s become an internet sensation, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s EveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s job to calm the sponsors and put a spin on the unexpected exposure.\n \nAnd they both have the same drive.\n \nIt may be a public relations job, but now that EveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seen whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s under NolanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crew suit, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gotten personal. After a few dates she has Nolan pretty revved up. If only sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d learn to relax and enjoy it. NolanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sure that the spontaneous birthday bash heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s throwing for Eve in Las Vegas should loosen her up. Somewhere between cocktails and a smoking-hot motel-room derby, it does more than that. Now EveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wrestling with feelings she never expected, as everything about her personal jackman gets harder than she ever imagined.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c98968582e7a7281b564aec99a8c7e6b2af79a17","amp;dn":"Jacked+Up+Erin+McCarthy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c98968582e7a7281b564aec99a8c7e6b2af79a17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,137,104,88,46,122,114,129,181,100,174,201,154,140,126,107,42,247,154,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

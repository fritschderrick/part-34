Cartoon illustrations give the book pick-me-up appeal, but it's the games themselves that will keep readers going as they match wits with Gardner, challenge their friends, or simply read along and look up the answers in the back. The publisher notes that &quot;some of the puzzles appeared in slightly different form in The Arrow Book of Brainteasers. The many libraries without that volume on their shelves may want to consider this one, just for fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af32c2bb8fdfd602ba5f138667500a3be78476db","amp;dn":"Classic+Brainteasers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af32c2bb8fdfd602ba5f138667500a3be78476db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,50,194,187,143,223,214,2,186,95,19,134,103,80,10,59,231,132,118,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The name stands for \\&quot;Operating System/2,\\&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM\\'s \\&quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)\\&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t\n\nBelieve it or else, these are disk images from the original\nMicrosoft OS/2 v1.0!\n\nImages are made using XDFCOPY, which will run in both OS/2 (with\nXDFORMAT.FLT installed) and DOS.

Since then I have come across excerpts of the 1939 production with \n\nKenny Baker. I was impressed but discouraged by the difficulty obtaining a copy. It \n\ntook considerable time to download the large ISO file. Determined to make it more\n\navailable I am uploading this version. It was only after finishing did I notice that\n\nthe general opinion of it was no too favorable as you can read by my inclosed text\n\nfile from IMBd.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fa025946a701f783821e0fa959bffa4d07ea835","amp;dn":"The+Mikado+1939","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fa025946a701f783821e0fa959bffa4d07ea835","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,160,37,148,106,112,31,120,56,33,224,250,149,155,255,164,208,126,168,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

However, three huge ego&amp;#039;s were way too much to fit in one band and the band exploded without ever releasing an album after having existed one month in 1977. Supposedly only four tracks were recorded. \n\nPete then spent his entire carreer in different incarnations of Wah!, using different names like &quot;The mighty wah!&quot; or &quot;Wah! the mongrel&quot;, all bands having one thing in common: They&amp;#039;re Pete Wylie with a group of musicians. \n\nIn 1987 Pete released an album using his own name for once which instantly brought him a few UK top 40 hits with &quot;Sinful&quot; and &quot;Diamond girl&quot;. After this album he went back releasing music as Wah! with or without additions. \n\nIn 2003 Pete, self acclaimed &amp;#039;Part time rockstar, full time legend&amp;#039;, bitterly announced his retirement from the music business, however he does still perform  occasionly. One thing, this is a-two-CD compilation but CD one is missing in action! If I find it, I&amp;#039;ll add another torrent. Pete Wylie fans, enjoy this and seed please.\n\n\nTracklisting:\n\n01 Sinful  \n02 Diamond Girl  \n03 If I Love You  \n04 Never Fall for a Whore  \n05 Four Eleven Forty Four   \n06 Pete Wylie and Wah! the Mongrel - Don&amp;#039;t Lose Your Dreams (Excerpt from a      \n   Teenage Opera), Pt. 154  \n07 Pete Wylie and Wah! the Mongrel - Circle of Salt  \n08 Pete Wylie and Wah! the Mongrel - Kerry Baby  \n09 Pete Wylie and Wah! the Mongrel - Long Tall Scally (The Ballad Thereof)  \n10 Pete Wylie and Wah! the Mongrel - Getting Out of It...  \n11 The Mighty Wah! - Heart as Big as Liverpool \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed94eca86a419050e9e004734f3f58ee9ddaedf8","amp;dn":"Pete+Wylie+-+The+Handy+Wah%21+Whole","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed94eca86a419050e9e004734f3f58ee9ddaedf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,148,236,168,106,65,144,80,233,224,4,115,79,63,88,238,157,218,237,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

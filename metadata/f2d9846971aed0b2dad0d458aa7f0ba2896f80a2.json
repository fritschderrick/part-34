Introducing English Linguistics accomplishes this goal in two ways. First, it takes a top-down approach to language, beginning with the largest unit of linguistic structure, the text, and working its way down through successively smaller structures (sentences, words, and finally speech sounds). The advantage of presenting language this way is that students are first given the larger picture - they study language in context - and then see how the smaller pieces of language are a consequence of the larger goals of linguistic communication. Second, the book does not contain invented examples, as is the case with most comparable texts, but instead takes its sample materials from the major computerised databases of spoken and written English, giving students a more realistic view of language.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 270 pages\n    * Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (June 22, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0521541220\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0521541220","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2d9846971aed0b2dad0d458aa7f0ba2896f80a2","amp;dn":"Introducing+English+Linguistics%28BBS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2d9846971aed0b2dad0d458aa7f0ba2896f80a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,217,132,105,113,174,208,178,218,208,212,88,170,127,11,162,137,111,128,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It was the most successful album of his solo career, having reached #22 on the charts and releasing two Top 20 singles with &quot;Smuggler's Blues&quot; and &quot;Sexy Girl&quot;. The album was well received by most critics and helped Frey become a familiar face throughout the decade. The album reached gold status. The single &quot;Smuggler's Blues&quot; helped inspire the Miami Vice episode and Frey was invited to star in the episode. The music video for the single also won Frey an MTV Video Music Award in 1985.\n\nIn a contemporary review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a &quot;C&quot; and panned it as a &quot;smarmy piece of sexist pseudosoul&quot;. In a retrospective review, Allmusic's William Ruhlmann gave it four-and-a-half out of five stars and said that it departs from the &quot;old Eagles sound&quot; of Frey's last album for a &quot;bluesy, rocking feel.&quot;\n\nGlenn Lewis Frey (pronounced Fry; born November 6, 1948) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and actor, best known as a founding member of the Eagles.

After the breakup of the Eagles in 1980, Frey embarked on a successful solo career. He released his debut album in 1982 and went on to record Top 40 hits &quot;The One You Love&quot;, &quot;Smuggler's Blues&quot;, &quot;Sexy Girl&quot;, &quot;The Heat Is On&quot;, and &quot;You Belong to the City&quot;.

In the end, the last brutal basket proves very difficult for the finalists.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 09-Apr-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e824a07c6998f2d5c9d6cebfbcaff5042c1e242","amp;dn":"Chopped.S15E02.Viewers.Choice.Baskets.PDTV.XviD-JIVE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e824a07c6998f2d5c9d6cebfbcaff5042c1e242","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,130,74,7,198,153,143,45,92,157,108,235,251,202,255,80,66,193,226,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

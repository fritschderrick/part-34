The band started as a quartet consisting of Thomas Adam, Steffen Keth, Stefan Blender, and Markus Ganssert. They formed the band in 1988. The name De/Vision is a play on words. The majority of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrics are in English, but they have had some songs in German. Markus left the band in 2000. In the same year Steffen started a side project as the vocalists with Green Court, called Ã¢â‚¬ËœGreen Court featuring De/VisionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The band with remaining members Thomas Adam and Steffen Keth is currently signed to Drakkar Records in Europe and Dancing Ferret Discs in North America.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b67e6ea99be58acbd33eb8807245b755de29217","amp;dn":"DeVision+-+Strange+Days+%5B2013%5D+%5B4CD%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b67e6ea99be58acbd33eb8807245b755de29217","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,103,230,234,153,190,88,172,189,51,235,136,7,36,91,117,93,226,146,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

On their lasted CD, ...and the Band Played On!, you'll find twenty two tracks, and over forty-nine minutes of music. How's that for punk?\n\nThe CD starts off with &quot;The Modern Day Wild West.&quot; Once the music picks up, they play it loud and fast. The drums are beaten furiously, while the bass is hammered on with fierce power. The guitar screams through the entire song, as the guitarist plays it with no mercy. The vocals are fast, and almost screaming, but they still keep it melodic. After some sampling concerning taking the money, or picking the box track two is kicked into gear. &quot;Tara&quot; is a sad love song about a guy who has a crush on a girl, can't tell her how he feels, but it doesn't matter because &quot;Tara doesn't want me in her arms.&quot; But don't let the song depress you. They play it fast enough, melodic enough, hard enough, and raw enough for you to enjoy the song regardless of the lyrical content. Another sample goes off, before track three starts. &quot;Cools&quot; starts out with a delicious bass line, while the drums are playing in the back. The whole band pulls it together and everything starts to rip. &quot;Floppy Disk&quot; is a song about &quot;geeks&quot; taking over the world, and Lick 57's fear that moment. I think they're just afraid of people who can use technology? What do you think? But the song is pretty decent, except for the vocals. I don't know what it is, but on this track the vocals are all scratchy, yelling, and way too high in the mix. &quot;I'm Tired&quot; is full on head attack. Snotty punk vocal starting, fast guitars, some good bass lines, and drums that kill make this song a keeper. The CD closes with &quot;Attack of the Bossman.&quot; It ends the CD with some speed. What is faster, you or the song? You'll be running to hit the repeat button on this CD. Twenty two nicely composed melodic punk songs that go from fast to the speed of light. You'll love it.\n\nLick 57's can play it fast, furious, and melodic. What more would you want in a punk band?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IkzifuY.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IkzifuY.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4667d847a6b38d4faf662286330bb801c94eb998","amp;dn":"Lick+57%27s+-+...And+The+Band+Played+On%21+%5B1996%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4667d847a6b38d4faf662286330bb801c94eb998","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,103,216,71,166,179,141,79,175,102,34,134,51,11,184,1,201,78,185,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

There's not much to distinguish these from other Jackson performances of the period, other than perhaps the sparse accompaniment, a slightly distant quality to the recording of the vocals, and a sense of event from a live audience that didn't have the opportunity to see Jackson nearly as often as Americans did.  Her favorites &quot;Elijah Rock&quot; and &quot;Down By the Riverside&quot; are here, as are compositions by Thomas Dorsey and Clara Ward, and -- more unexpectedly -- Rodgers-Hammerstein's &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone.&quot;  The 2001 CD release on Columbia/Legacy adds two previously unreleased songs recorded a week later in France, &quot;Didn't It Rain&quot; and &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In.&quot; - by Richie Unterberger, AMG\n \nPersonnel:\nMahalia Jackson (Vocal) \nMildred Falls (Piano) \n\nMahalia Jackson - Live in Europe Tracks:\n01  Tell The World About This (Traditional) 2:43 \n02  There Is A Balm In Gilead (Traditional) 5:18 \n03  Down By The Riverside (Traditional) 4:33 \n04  In My Home Over There (H.J.

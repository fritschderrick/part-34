I received these in a trade years ago, they were burned TAO, which means there were two second gaps between each track. I imported them to Adobe Audition as one long track, edited out the gaps and re-cut the tracks. Some of the tracks segue into each other oddly, it almost sounds like they were recorded at different shows, or the recorded literally paused between each song. I have tried to minimize the effect of this as much as possible without losing too much of the show. These are not perfect, but I felt they needed to be shared as I have never seen a Mic Christopher show circulated anywhere. Please feel free to share these anywhere you please.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e78f6cce876d9ff72b2e4d1182272483602540eb","amp;dn":"2+Mic+Christopher+shows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e78f6cce876d9ff72b2e4d1182272483602540eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,143,108,206,135,109,159,247,43,46,77,17,130,39,36,131,96,37,64,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

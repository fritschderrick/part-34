There are 11 files in this unabridged version recorded by Karen White.  Ripped from Audio CD.  I don't have a total hours, but each file is about an hour of running time.\n\nBailey Weggins is a crime writer for Gloss magazine in Manhattan. Smart and savvy, she's got a sixth sense when it comes to seeing the truth in a story. The action starts when a dead body is found in the editor's home.

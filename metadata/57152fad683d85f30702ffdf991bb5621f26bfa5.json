If you made it there, you had it made because for the first time, the entire county was at home watching. During the course of the show's run, many of the early rock and roll legends were featured in career-defining performances. These cultural milestones have been compiled for Ed Sullivan's Rock 'n' Roll Classics, along with archival footage and narration for insight on the artists, their eras, and their classic appearances. Now seen with half a century of hindsight, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clear Ed Sullivan was right--his was a really big show. \n\n\n-The Temptations &amp; The Supremes: The Temptations (Songs: Don't Look Back, September In The Rain, You've Made Me So Very Happy, Run Away Child, I Can't Get Next To You, Just My Imagination), The Supremes (Songs: Come See About Me, Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart, I'm Living In Shame, Forever Came Today, No Matter What Sign You Are, Up The Ladder To The Roof)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57152fad683d85f30702ffdf991bb5621f26bfa5","amp;dn":"Ed+Sullivan%5C%27s+Rock%5C%27n%5C%27Roll+Classics+-5+AVI+VIDEO+Rel+by+SHAR19","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57152fad683d85f30702ffdf991bb5621f26bfa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,21,47,173,104,61,133,243,7,2,255,223,153,27,181,98,31,38,191,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

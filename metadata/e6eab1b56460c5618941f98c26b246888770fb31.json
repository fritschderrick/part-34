Having spent tens of hours editing periodic announcements out of DJ sets recorded off the radio, it presented an interesting challenge.\n\nI listened through the episodes multiple times and anything that didn't work like long passages of music, or where Carl refers to something on-screen (eg. &quot;shown here&quot; or &quot;this photo&quot;) were edited out. Most of the edits are seamless but some noticeable ones were unavoidable without access to the master tapes.\n\nThe only content of note that didn't work &quot;for radio&quot; was a sequence in episode 7 where Carl shows some pictures and planetary models to primary school students, and another in episode 12 where he translates some Egyptian Hieroglyphics from Greek. \n\nFor anyone wondering, I chose 32khz because it is close to 44kHz in quality, and surprisingly, 48kbps CBR was indistinguishable from 56k CBR and 48-56kbps ABR. \n\nSource: Region 4 PAL DVD\nAC3 files extracted with DVD Decrypter\nConverted to WAV with AC3filter and Winamp\nDownmixed and edited with with Sony Sound Forge 8.0d\nEncoded with LAME 3.98 and Lame-Front-End\nFrequency: 32kHz\nBitrate: 48kbps CBR\nChannels: Mono\n\nEpisode info available at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGood accompaniments to Cosmos: Podcast Edition in my opinion are the TTC Big History lectures (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4162163/) and A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3964818/).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6eab1b56460c5618941f98c26b246888770fb31","amp;dn":"Cosmos%3A+Podcast+Edition+-+Carl+Sagan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6eab1b56460c5618941f98c26b246888770fb31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,234,177,181,100,96,197,97,137,65,249,140,38,178,70,136,135,112,251,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

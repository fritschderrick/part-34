The album was the second of the band's to be produced by 1980s producer Rupert Hine. Although it did not receive the commercial success of the previous collaboration between the band and Hine, both &quot;The Flyer&quot; and &quot;Cat Walk&quot; became respectable radio hits for the band with the album eventually securing gold status in Canada and Germany.\n\n1. &quot;The Flyer&quot;\n2. &quot;Cat Walk&quot;\n3. &quot;The Sound of Strangers&quot;\n4. &quot;The Writing&quot;\n5. &quot;Intermission&quot;\n6. &quot;Social Orphan&quot;\n7. &quot;The Vendetta (Still Helpless)&quot;\n8. &quot;Scratching the Surface&quot;\n9. &quot;The Pitchman&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93c30c1a9dfcfcdee886486e0cfdf4b253985ae5","amp;dn":"Saga+-+Heads+Or+Tales+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93c30c1a9dfcfcdee886486e0cfdf4b253985ae5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,195,12,26,157,252,252,222,232,134,72,110,12,253,244,178,83,152,90,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

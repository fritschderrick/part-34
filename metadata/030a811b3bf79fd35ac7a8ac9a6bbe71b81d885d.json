And that is the strength of this record: its ability to wash the listener over in waves of nostalgia, and wonder, with a sense of introspective inquiry that could make one wistful or regretful, depending on their disposition.At times they burst forth with wild and unbounded joy (Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Love You So Much!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sing SingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and in other moments they chill with haunting melodies and arrangements (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wayfairing StrangerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Without SomeoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) that one could mistake for a compilation. However, when listened to as a piece of art, an intricate weaving emerges, with tracks running into one another delicately enough to sound seamless.\n\nSinger and bassist Sarah BennÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice shifts between driving Janis Joplin-like lashings (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mopping FloorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“GenerationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) to soft croons that bring to mind Roy OrbisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most tender moments (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Holly HolyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“D.H. LawrenceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). While similarities can be drawn, her voice and delivery is unique enough to stand as a whole novel thing.\n\nJayson BennÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬â€ yes, relation Ã¢â‚¬â€ guitar playing creates a moving soundscape, which bounds from fevered and frantic, wailing to hush tones and plucking. The latter particularly shows the musicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finesse with his instrument.\n\nOverall the record has a much more focused feel than the previous release. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sing SingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an album that showcases a band finding its stride and clipping along at an exhilarating and enrapturing pace.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:030a811b3bf79fd35ac7a8ac9a6bbe71b81d885d","amp;dn":"Shivering+Timbers+-+Sing+Sing+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2CLog%2CCue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"030a811b3bf79fd35ac7a8ac9a6bbe71b81d885d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,10,129,27,59,247,159,211,90,199,168,172,154,107,190,113,184,29,136,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

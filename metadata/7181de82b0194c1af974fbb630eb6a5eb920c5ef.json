In chronological order, he informs the reader of many such events, tracing them back as early as the IV century and continuing onward: In the IV century, there was at least 1 recorded case, V century ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1, VII century ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1, IX century ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3, XII century ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11, XIII century ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 10, XIV century ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5, XV century ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 12, XVI century ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 24, XVII century ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 39, XVIII century ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7, XIX century (when this book was published, in 1844) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 20.  In total, he mentions 134 cases.  Then, he passes to an examination of the Velizh case, one of the more famous cases in Russia: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFor positive confirmation that an accusation of Jewish ritual murder is not simply slander or fiction, and that not one torture of the Middle Ages extorted from Jews this horrible acknowledgement, it is necessary to examine in more detail one of the better-known and well-documented cases of such.  For example, the Velizh case was started on April 24, 1823 by the Velizh city police, and finished on January 18, 1835, a 12-year investigation in common meeting of State Council.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe examination of this case occupies almost 60 pages of this book in its original format. On the last few pages, V.I.Dal concludes: \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI examined the entire number of horrible events, which are proved judiciously throughout history.  The accusation that Jews painfully murder Gentile babies around Easter time is impossible to discount as if a mere ghost story and superstition, and it is necessary to be convinced that this accusation is indeed reasonable.  There is a common opinion as to the JewsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ usage of these martyrsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ blood for some type of mysterious magical ritesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.  Of course, no intelligent person will dispute that in countries where Jews are tolerated, from time to time, the corpses of babies were discoveredÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½almost always found in the same distorted condition or, at the least, showing that they suffered a similar violent deathÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.  It is not just murder but, rather, the premeditated painful torture of innocent babies, committed by those who enjoy these torments for the special reasons associated with themÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.  From whence are these corpses of innocent children, intentionally distorted in the same manner?  Why are these corpses only discovered in areas where the Jews reside?  And, finally, why do these cases, almost exclusively, occur around Easter time?  The religious ceremony that results in mutilation does not occur among all Jews but, rather, without any doubt, only among the smallest portion of them: It exists only in the sect of the Hasidic Jews, a sect with the most persistent fanaticism, who acknowledge only Talmudic and Rabbinical books and renounce the Old Testament; but this is their big secret, perhaps, since not all of their brethren know about it and, of course, not all of the Hasidic Jews participate in it.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThere is not, however, any doubt that it has occurred since the time of Christianity spreading.  And, from time to time, Jewish fanatics and cabalistic wizards appear who, having this double purpose, engage in the painful killing of a Gentile baby and use his blood for mystical and religious purposes in an effort to create magic.  Since the Middle Ages, Poland and our western provinces served as shelter for this inveterate and ignorant Jewish society; and now those areas represent the largest number of examples of such mutilations, especially the Vitebsk province where the Hasidic sect has significantly spread.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n----------------\n\nV.I.

The only joy in Frank's life are his calls to the government pension processing center when he gets to talk to his case worker Sarah (Mary-Louis Parker). Sarah is as bored and lonely as Frank and marks her conversations with the unknown Frank and her spy novels as the only things fun in her life. When something in Frank's past forces Frank back into his old line of work and puts an unwitting Sarah in the middle of the intrigue, Frank and Sarah begin a journey into Franks past and the people he used to work with. Like Frank they are all RED ... Retired Extremely Dangerous.\n\n\nImdb:       &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1245526/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1245526/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n             Users: (56,603 votes) 234 reviews | Critics: 253 reviews \n             \n             Imbd: 7.0/10\n \nRuntime:     111 min\n\nYear:        2010\n\nGengre:      Action | Comedy | Thriller\n\nScource:     Dvd/Retail/Pal/\n\nRars:        No\n\nFormat:      Iso\n\nSubs:        Swedish\n             Norwegian\n             Danish\n             Finish\n\nAudio:       English (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n             English (DTS 5.1)\n\nFormat:      Dvd\n\nMenu:        Yes\n\nExtras:      Yes\n\nStripped     No\n\nDirector:    Robert Schwentke\nWriters:     Jon Hoeber\n             Erich Hoeber\n \nStars:       Bruce Willis\n             Helen Mirren \n             Morgan Freeman\n  \n\n                       \n\n                    ENJOY COMMENT &amp; SEED !SNOOPY72 =) \n\n                               \n\n                      ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c3197615fe061565ae523524ff990d2cea56c52","amp;dn":"Red.2010.NORDIC.RETAIL.DVDR.PAL-SNOOPY72","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c3197615fe061565ae523524ff990d2cea56c52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,49,151,97,95,224,97,86,90,229,35,82,79,249,144,210,206,165,108,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

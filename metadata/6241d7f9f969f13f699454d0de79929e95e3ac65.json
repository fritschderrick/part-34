It features an eclectic mix of acoustic folk reminiscent of Scandinavian bands such as Ulver, doom and black metal-esque riffs, growled, clean, whispered, and shrieked vocals, and a production style and atmosphere that borrows heavily from black metal. The lyrical themes focus mainly on depression, nature, folklore, and the supernatural. It features the roots of a post-rock influence which is greatly expanded on in AgallochÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second studio album, The Mantle.\n\nTracklist:\n1. She Painted Fire Across the Skyline I\n2.

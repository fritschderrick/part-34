This miniseries chronicles the life of Christ's most prolific messenger. Paul, originally known as Saul of Tarsus, was a persecutor of Christians until Jesus came to him in a vision. Forever changed, Paul withstood persecution and imprisonment and with unflagging determination he spread the word of Christ. Beautifully shot in the Moroccan desert, Paul the Apostle is a sweeping saga of a man whose story continues after the Passion of Christ.\nDirector: Roger Young\nProducer(s): Paolo Lucidi\n\nThese Torrents are currently on a Free Leech --  High Speed Server\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\nEphesians 5:11\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n                                             \n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37983d063a3ff0a642127d4b94077c0267d91dce","amp;dn":"POtHS+3+-+Bible+-+105+-+Paul+of+Tarsus+-+5+Languages","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37983d063a3ff0a642127d4b94077c0267d91dce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,152,61,6,58,63,240,166,66,18,125,75,148,7,124,2,103,217,29,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

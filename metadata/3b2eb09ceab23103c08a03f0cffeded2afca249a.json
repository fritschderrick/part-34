Father Ben is a dentist who'd like to see his children move out of the house as soon as possible because all he wants is peace and quiet. His eldest son Nick - who later on in the series does move out - is a complete idiot and a no-good who can't hold on to any of the various jobs he has. Daughter Janey is very shallow and not very picky when it comes to boys while son Michael is way too smart for Ben and doesn't feel the need to communicate much with his father. His curious wife Susan clearly makes all the decisions in the household. Later on in the series Ben gets an assistant at work, goofy and naive Roger, and when Janey finally moves out, no-brainer Abby moves in, while Janey keeps visiting, sometimes bringing along her little son, Kenzo. So much for Ben's peace and quiet.\n\n\n\nVideo:\n\n720x406\n1000 kbps\n25 fps\n\n\nAudio:\n\n192 kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\n44 kHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b2eb09ceab23103c08a03f0cffeded2afca249a","amp;dn":"My+Family+Season+1+%282000%29+250MB+DVDRip+AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b2eb09ceab23103c08a03f0cffeded2afca249a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,46,176,156,234,178,49,3,192,138,3,240,207,254,222,210,175,202,36,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It is a brand new track just opened in Fall 2012 with an F1 race. The course is 3.41 miles long and 20 turns.\n\nThis video is in the form of a .ISO file intended to be burned to a blank DVD of 4.4GB. It is in Blu-Ray format BD5 so it should play well on any external Blu-Ray console connected to a large-screen HDTV. All of the commercials, station breaks, and on-air promos have been deleted so the race action flows very smoothly.\n\n\n\nVideo:    AVCHD H.264 1280x720 (720p) at 3793Kbps and 59.95fps\nAudio:    AC-3, 6 channel Dolby 5.1, 384kbps, 48KHz, 16bits\nDuration: 2 hours 20 minutes\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3f3bcc2f8b41240df08356e037f71a19705ac7b","amp;dn":"GRAND-AM+Rolex+Sports+Car+Series+R02+-+Austin+TX+2Mar13+BD5+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3f3bcc2f8b41240df08356e037f71a19705ac7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,243,188,194,248,180,18,64,223,8,53,110,3,127,113,161,151,5,172,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

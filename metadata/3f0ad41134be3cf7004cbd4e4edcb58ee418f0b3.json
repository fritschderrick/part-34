From its beginnings as a human-alien story of first contact, the Foreigner series has become a true science fiction odyssey, following a civilization from the age of steam through early space flight to confrontations with other alien species in distant sectors of space. It is the masterwork of a truly remarkable author.\n\nNearly two centuries after the starship Phoenix disappeared, leaving an isolated colony of humans on the world of the atevi, it unexpectedly returns, threatening the stability of both atevi and human governments. With the situation fast becoming critical, Bren Cameron, the brilliant, young paidhi to the court of the atevi is recalled from Mospheira where he has just undergone surgery. Upon his return to the mainland, he Cameron finds that his government has sent in his paidhi-successor, Deana HanksÃ¢â‚¬â€representative of a dangerous faction on Mospheira who hate the atevi.\n\nHaunted by the threat of assassination, Bren realizes his only hope may be to communicate with the Phoenix as the spokesman of the ateviÃ¢â‚¬â€an action which may cut him off for good from his own species. Yet if he doesn't take this desperate action, he may be forced to witness the destruction of the already precarious balance of world power.\n\nThe long-running Foreigner series can also be enjoyed by more casual genre readers in sub-trilogy installments. Invader is the 2nd Foreigner novel. It is also the 2nd book in the first subtrilogy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f0ad41134be3cf7004cbd4e4edcb58ee418f0b3","amp;dn":"C.+J.+Cherryh+-+Invader","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f0ad41134be3cf7004cbd4e4edcb58ee418f0b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,10,212,17,52,190,60,247,0,76,189,78,78,220,181,142,228,24,240,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The volume presents in a balanced manner the fundamental and advanced concepts, principles, and models as well as their first and novel combinations and applications in modeling complex natural or designed phenomena","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ba5dc6212e13735804a572386514071da22159b","amp;dn":"Quantum+Nanochemistry+Vol.+1+-+Quantum+Theory+and+Observability","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ba5dc6212e13735804a572386514071da22159b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,165,220,98,18,225,55,53,128,74,87,35,134,81,64,113,218,34,21,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

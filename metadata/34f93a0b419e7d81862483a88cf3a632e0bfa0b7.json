His ability to take a song and make it his own is clear on both the uptempo (&quot;Respect&quot;) and ballads (&quot;Try A Little Tenderness&quot;). It is likely that you will have most of these in your collection if you are a Soul fan, but for the more casual listener, this is a very good place to start - and it includes the sublime &quot;That&amp;#039;s How Strong...&quot;, on it&amp;#039;s own worth the price.

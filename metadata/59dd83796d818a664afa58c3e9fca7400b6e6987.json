For the most of them, all you have to do is extract/install with one\na few clicks and then you are ready to go. Almost all games are already\nupdated, patched and cracked. Just install and PLAY! On some I have even\nincluded mods, extra maps and other stuff...\n\nThis package focuses on providing a great foundation for your LAN-party.\nIn other words, all games are multiplayer games! However, you can also play\nsingle player on all the games (if everyone else needs to sleep).\nThis package will make sure that there will always be something to play.\nHeck, you don't even need an internet connection, just store this package \non a shared disk and thats it. \n\nThis package contains 25 different games (not counting addons, expansions\nand mods). \n\nThe main focus of this package has been to include games with COOP-capabilities.\n\nI ahve also included a folder with some extras, like disk defragmenter,\ndirectx, physx and some tweaks. You should start by installing Directx!\n\nCheck the readme located in every gamefolder for installation instructions\nas well as further information about the game.\n\nALL GAMES EXCEPT GRAW2 and Railroad Tycoon 3 has been tested to work on both\nXP and Vista Sp1.

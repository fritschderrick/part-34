Protesters have been attacked with guns, clubs and fists. If arrested, they face the possibility of being tortured to death.\n\nThe protesters against Ahmedinejad and Khameini have used a strategy of nonviolence. Almost all of the people you see being arrested, beaten and killed in these videos have done nothing more than carry a sign or shout a slogan.\n\nThe protesters are not fighting against Islam. They are not fighting for America or Britain or Israel. All they want is the free, peaceful, democratic Iran their parents and grandparents fought and died for.\n\nIf you want to help, join us at http://iran.whyweprotest.net/\n\nThe master list of Anonymous's Iran videos is located at http://gonzotimes.net/?page_id=500\n\n:ÃƒËœÃ‚Â§ÃƒËœÃ‚Â¯ÃƒËœÃ‚Â¨Ãƒâ€ºÃ…â€™ÃƒËœÃ‚Â§ÃƒËœÃ‚Âª ÃƒËœÃ‚Â§Ãƒâ„¢Ã¢â‚¬Â Ãƒâ„¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ„¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒËœÃ‚Â§ÃƒËœÃ‚Â¨Ãƒâ€ºÃ…â€™ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4973942/Persian_revolutionary_literature_______________&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4973942/Persian_revolutionary_literature_______________&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe government in Iran is still increasing internet filtering and throttling in an attempt to silence their people.

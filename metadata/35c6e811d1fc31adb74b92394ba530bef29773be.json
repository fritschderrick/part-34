Now, two Trolltech insiders have written a start-to-finish guide to getting outstanding results with the latest version of Qt: Qt 4.3.\n\nPacked with realistic examples and in-depth advice, this is the book Trolltech uses to teach Qt to its own new hires. Extensively revised and expanded, it reveals today's best Qt programming patterns for everything from implementing model/view architecture to using Qt 4.3's improved graphics support. You'll find proven solutions for virtually every GUI development task, as well as sophisticated techniques for providing database access, integrating XML, using subclassing, composition, and more. Whether you're new to Qt or upgrading from an older version, this book can help you accomplish everything that Qt 4.3 makes possible.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35c6e811d1fc31adb74b92394ba530bef29773be","amp;dn":"C%2B%2B+GUI+Programming+with+Qt+4+%28Second+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35c6e811d1fc31adb74b92394ba530bef29773be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,198,232,17,209,252,49,173,183,75,146,57,75,165,48,190,242,151,115,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Also there are some casting errors in TCC, if you notice them, use GCC.\n\nLong click save button to &quot;save as&quot;, long click run to run with arguments.\nC4droid already has almost full C language support, so you don't need to wait when it will be added.\nYou can to write your own applications on the Android phone, and run them.

Pumpkin pie. ShepherdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pie. Chicken potpie. Sweet or savory, pies are beloved; everyone has a favorite. Yet despite its widespread appeal there has never been a book devoted to this humble dishÃ¢â‚¬â€until now.\nJanet Clarkson in Pie illustrates how what was once a purely pragmatic dish of thick layers of dough has grown into an esteemed creation of culinary art. There is as much debate about how to perfect the ideal, flaky pastry crust as there is about the very definition of a pie: Must it have a top and bottom crust? Is a pasty a pie? In flavorful detail, Clarkson celebrates the pie in all its variations. She touches pon the pieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commercial applications, nutritional value, and cultural significance; and she examines its international variations, from BritainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pork pie and Australia and New ZealandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s endless varieties of meat pie to the Russian kurnik and good old-fashioned American apple pie.\nThis delectable salute to the many pies enjoyed the world over will satisfy the appetites of all readers hungry for culinary history and curious about the many varieties of this delightful food, and it just might inspire them to don aprons and head for the stove.\n\n===================================================================================\nEditorial Review\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nStarred Review. Clarkson's loving ode to pie is a rich, savory history of one of the world's oldest and most iconic dishes. Pie plates being, quite literally, the first baking container, virtually all baked goods that weren't bread were known as pie. While winnowing down the definition, Clarkson finds that the first pies-as-we-know-them offered an ingeniously efficient mode for preserving fillings like meat and vegetables. Portability was a bonus feature-workers and travelers have been carrying pies with them at least since Chaucer's time-making them stalwarts for cooks of all skill levels. The book's slim page count belies a wealth of information, including the science of flaky crust, recipes from yesteryear, the real-life inspirations for famous pie lovers like Georgie Porgie and Little Jack Horner, and a brief dissertation on why pie is so delicious (&quot;biology makes us do it&quot;). With enthusiasm and detailed research, Clarkson's entertaining history is a nutrient-rich meal for the mind, sure to be devoured as happily as its subject. 40 color plates.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n'This homage to the pie is stylishly presented.

Using examples from a broad base of computational tasks, including data processing, computational photography, and animation, the textbook introduces numerical modeling and algorithmic design from a practical standpoint and provides insight into the theoretical tools needed to support these skills.\r\n\r\nThe book covers a wide range of topicsâ€•from numerical linear algebra to optimization and differential equationsâ€•focusing on real-world motivation and unifying themes. It incorporates cases from computer science research and practice, accompanied by highlights from in-depth literature on each subtopic. Comprehensive end-of-chapter exercises encourage critical thinking and build studentsâ€™ intuition while introducing extensions of the basic material.\r\n\r\nThe text is designed for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in computer science and related fields with experience in calculus and linear algebra. For students with a background in discrete mathematics, the book includes some reminders of relevant continuous mathematical background","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61391fd51337dfac6bb5e3f0e33422ceb43c4e34","amp;dn":"Numerical+Algorithms+-+Justin+Solomon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61391fd51337dfac6bb5e3f0e33422ceb43c4e34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,57,31,213,19,55,223,172,107,181,227,240,227,52,34,206,180,60,78,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

His radical theories of &quot;psychetecture&quot; cause the citizenry to go mad, just as he did, and he takes on the mission to repair his creation.\n\n To accomplish this he remains awake twenty-four hours a day by means of the drug &quot;insomnalin,&quot; all the while coping with a Dick TracyÃ¢â‚¬â€œlike rogues gallery and supporting cast including his long-suffering ex-girlfriend Mercedes.\n\n Mister X's influence can be seen and was acknowledged in films like Terry Gilliam's Brazil,[6] Tim Burton's Batman,[7] and Alex Proyas' Dark City.\n\n After the first volume of the Motter-based series ended in 1985, a second 12-issue black-and-white series concluding the saga was written by Jeffrey Morgan. The first six issues were penciled by Shane Oakley, and the remaining six by D'Israeli with inks by Ken Holewczynski.\n\n Although a 13th issue of Volume II was published, beginning a story by Seth (writing as &quot;Wilbur Webb&quot;) the rest of the story remained unpublished until it appeared in New Worlds Anthology [will scan at a later date]. In 1996, Caliber Comics published Volume 3, a 4-issue story by Deborah Marks [can be found here , if not please e-mail me and I will re-seed]\n\n Please Seed and Enjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa5fff21c12d7d555a00587b8b12aab7b7efc595","amp;dn":"Mister+X+%281989%29+Vol.+2+Vortex+Comics+%5Bcomplete+and+re-scanned%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa5fff21c12d7d555a00587b8b12aab7b7efc595","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,95,255,33,193,45,125,85,90,0,88,123,139,18,170,183,183,239,197,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

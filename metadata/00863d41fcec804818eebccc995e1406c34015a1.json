There is nothing that mankind needs more than Christ's Divine Mercy. To help us avail ourselves of that loving mercy, Fr. Brooks focuses on what we know of God's Mercy, our response to His Love, how we can become merciful to others, and how to become apostles of mercy. \n\nBonus: At the end of this presentation, the Divine Mercy chaplet is led by Fr. Francis Peffley, Mark Forrest - an Irish tenor, and Muriel Forrest.\n\nFiletype: MP3\nLength: 59:00\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lighthousecatholicmedia.org/store/title/the-saving-power-of-divine-mercy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lighthousecatholicmedia.org/store/title/the-saving-power-of-divine-mercy&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoy this presentation, please support Lighthouse Catholic Media, NFP, which is a 501(c)(3) Not For Profit Company that seeks to answer the call for a New Evangelization.

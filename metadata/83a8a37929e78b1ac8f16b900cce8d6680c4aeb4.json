In F-15, the player flies the F-15E Strike Eagle while in F/A-18 the player flies the F/A-18E Super Hornet. The aircrafts which the player flies are considered to be meticulously detailed and very accurate.\n\nTo install, simply mount, install (use compatibility mode for Vista/Seven users), then apply patch.\n\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83a8a37929e78b1ac8f16b900cce8d6680c4aeb4","amp;dn":"Jane%27s+F-15+%26amp%3B+F%2FA-18","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83a8a37929e78b1ac8f16b900cce8d6680c4aeb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,168,163,121,41,231,139,26,200,241,107,144,12,206,141,102,128,196,174,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

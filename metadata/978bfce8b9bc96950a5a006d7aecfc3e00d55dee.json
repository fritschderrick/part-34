What can be described as art rock with some elements of indie and prog rock, their music is noted for sophisticated arrangements and quite complex songsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ structures. Ã¢â‚¬Å“TootscatsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ use a large array of instruments, which makes the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s live gigs quite interesting to watch and listen to.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Jason ClauseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the first album of the band. Although each song is a part of a single plot (which could be identified only by a keen listener, however), the record doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to be tedious or awkward (which sometimes happens to conceptual art rock albums). All of 16 tracks flow smoothly, rhythms and styles change each other preventing listeners from getting bored.\n\nLine-up:\nAnton Solodky Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, keyboards, vocals\nRoman Makarov Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar, flute, keyboards, vocals\nAlexander Kashev Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums &amp; percussion, oboe, keyboards, vocals\n\nWith special guests:\nIlya Mishchenkov Ã¢â‚¬â€œ violins\nLeonid Moshkovich Ã¢â‚¬â€œ double-bass","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:978bfce8b9bc96950a5a006d7aecfc3e00d55dee","amp;dn":"Tootscats+-+Jason+Clause+%28art-rock%2C+2014%2C+mp3+320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"978bfce8b9bc96950a5a006d7aecfc3e00d55dee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,139,252,232,185,188,150,149,10,90,0,109,122,236,252,62,0,213,93,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

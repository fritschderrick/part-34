It has a destiny of its own in describing the workings of the Illuminati through fiction. Love, war, sex, revolution, mind control, the use of sociopaths, and the Social Darwinist mind of the world's financial elite. It's all here.\n\nIf you like Ayn Rand's works, try this action-packed but philosophic novel. It also reads like a combination of Tolstoy, Nabokov, and Pasternak.\n\nFor you libertarians that complain there are no freedom-oriented novels for you, try this one.\n\nFor those who love a good novel with plenty of sex and violence -- and  genuine heroes -- this is a great read.\n\nFor women looking for solid female characters -- good and evil -- try out this novel and you will be surprised.\n\nThe prose is outstanding! The book is a page-turner that will leave you thinking.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab78c0a937758ff0414f8a252a83ea710277d4f3","amp;dn":"Best+Illuminati+Novel+Written%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab78c0a937758ff0414f8a252a83ea710277d4f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,120,192,169,55,117,143,240,65,79,138,37,42,131,234,113,2,119,212,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

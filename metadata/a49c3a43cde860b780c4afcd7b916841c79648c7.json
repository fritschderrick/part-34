From the formation of the band in Glasgow to winning the first-ever Mercury prize, the band members explain the record's inception with insights from main producer Andrew Weatherall, Creation Records founder Alan McGee and many others involved with or inspired by this joyful record.\n\nScreamadelica both defines a generation and transcends its time, and is a true Classic Album.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a49c3a43cde860b780c4afcd7b916841c79648c7","amp;dn":"BBC+Classic+Albums+Primal+Scream%3A+Screamadelica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a49c3a43cde860b780c4afcd7b916841c79648c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,156,58,67,205,232,96,183,128,196,175,205,123,145,104,65,199,150,72,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

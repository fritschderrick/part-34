The space-time breach, called the Disjunction, allowed magical energies and powerful daemons to enter Earth during the Third Crusade.\n\nLionheart players will create and develop a character in this alternate universe, and choose how to pursue their destiny. The RPG character system, converted from the Fallout rules, includes 30 skills, 40 perks, and 15 traits. Since the system is classless, players can modify their character however they choose, and advance as far as level sixty. Lionheart's world contains eight major areas, 80 levels, and a mixture of story and combat arenas. The random item generator allows players to keep discovering new weapons, armor, and charms. Fifty enemies, 30 spells, and a multiplayer system allowing four players to cooperate are also featured.\n\n\nInstructions:\n:::::::::::::::::::::\n\n1) Unrar\n2) Mount or burn\n3) Install\n4) Update to 1.1 (lionheart11e.zip)\n5) Play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02428ed2e176327455c3bea286e112e755bc727f","amp;dn":"Lionheart-Legacy+of+the+Crusader","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02428ed2e176327455c3bea286e112e755bc727f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,66,142,210,225,118,50,116,85,195,190,162,134,225,18,231,85,188,114,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

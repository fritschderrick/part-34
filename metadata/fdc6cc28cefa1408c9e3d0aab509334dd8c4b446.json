Masina&amp;#039;s moon-faced and bright-eyed Cabiria is a passionate streetwalker with a heart as big as Italy and the emotional spontaneity of a child, a woman with a hearty passion for life whose constant weakness is falling in love with mercenary creeps. For a couple of hours we share the dreams and disillusionments of Cabiria as she rattles around Rome before once again losing her heart. The bittersweet heartbreak is tempered with a soaring celebration of the human spirit: no other Fellini film offers such honest hope in the face of such bitter devastation. Fellini left the poor and the working class to revel in the decadence of Rome&amp;#039;s high society for his next film, La Dolce Vita, a film that could have sprung from Cabiria&amp;#039;s hilarious chance interlude with a matinee idol (played by Amedeo Nazzari). Rambling and leisurely paced, Nights of Cabiria is a sweet film of warmth and simple grace. It became the basis of Neil Simon&amp;#039;s American musical Sweet Charity, with Shirley Maclaine taking Masina&amp;#039;s role in Bob Fosse&amp;#039;s film version.\n\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050783/\n\nOriginal Title...: Le Notti di Cabiria\nDirector.........: Federico Fellini\nYear.............: 1957\nCountry..........: Italy\nRunning Time.....: 118 minutes\nAudio............: Dolby Digital Mono 1.0\nSubtitles........: English + Spanish (custom)\nVideo Format.....: 1.33.1\nDVD Source.......: DVD9\nDVD Format.......: NTSC\nDVD Distributor..: The Criterion Collection\nProgram..........: DVD Decrypter 3.5.4\n\nMenus............: [X] Untouched\nVideo............: [X] Untouched\nDVD Extras.......: [X] Untouched\nDVD Audio........: [X] Untouched","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdc6cc28cefa1408c9e3d0aab509334dd8c4b446","amp;dn":"Le+Notti+di+Cabiria+%28AKA+Nights+of+Cabiria%29+-+Federico+Fellini+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdc6cc28cefa1408c9e3d0aab509334dd8c4b446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,198,204,40,206,250,20,8,201,227,208,170,181,9,51,77,216,196,180,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

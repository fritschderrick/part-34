Security vulnerabilities in Ethernet switches are multiple: from the switch implementation, to control plane protocols (Spanning Tree Protocol [STP], CiscoÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Discovery Protocol [CDP], and so on) and data plane protocols, such as Address Routing Protocol (ARP) or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). LAN Switch Security explains all the vulnerabilities in a network infrastructure related to Ethernet switches. Further, this book shows you how to configure a switch to prevent or to mitigate attacks based on those vulnerabilities. This book also includes a section on how to use an Ethernet switch to increase the security of a network and prevent future attacks.\n\nDivided into four parts, LAN Switch Security provides you with steps you can take to ensure the integrity of both voice and data traffic traveling over Layer 2 devices. Part I covers vulnerabilities in Layer 2 protocols and how to configure switches to prevent attacks against those vulnerabilities. Part II addresses denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on an Ethernet switch and shows how those attacks can be mitigated. Part III shows how a switch can actually augment the security of a network through the utilization of wirespeed access control list (ACL) processing and IEEE 802.1x for user authentication and authorization. Part IV examines future developments from the LinkSec working group at the IEEE. For all parts, most of the content is vendor independent and is useful for all network architects deploying Ethernet switches.\n\nAfter reading this book, you will have an in-depth understanding of LAN security and be prepared to plug the security holes that exist in a great number of campus networks.\n\nEric Vyncke has a masterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s degree in computer science engineering from the University of LiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ge in Belgium. Since 1997, Eric has worked as a Distinguished Consulting Engineer for Cisco, where he is a technical consultant for security covering Europe. His area of expertise for 20 years has been mainly security from Layer 2 to applications. He is also guest professor at Belgian universities for security seminars.\n\nChristopher Paggen, CCIEÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® No. 2659, obtained a degree in computer science from IESSL in LiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ge (Belgium) and a masterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s degree in economics from University of Mons-Hainaut (UMH) in Belgium. He has been with Cisco since 1996 where he has held various positions in the fields of LAN switching and security, either as pre-sales support, post-sales support, network design engineer, or technical advisor to various engineering teams.

I also provide new, beneficial articles on my personal blog. I hope that the resources, especially the forums, will help you increase your understanding and answer any questions you may have. As you progress in your overall ability, I also hope that you can find your own personal area(s) of specialization. It is with this in mind that I have provided a wide variety of resources that expand upon some of the areas I cover in Understanding Karate Do.\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://understandingkarate.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://understandingkarate.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63a09546850553f4032dcdc0eda68344d6fc47cd","amp;dn":"Johnston+Karate+Network+-+Recent+Posts+-+June%2FJuly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63a09546850553f4032dcdc0eda68344d6fc47cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,160,149,70,133,5,83,244,3,45,205,192,237,166,131,68,214,252,71,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

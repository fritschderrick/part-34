The style can be defined as mixture of electro industrial and darkwave. Especially the vocals tend to lean towards more lyrical side of dark independent scene.\n\nHaving said this one can't deny that at least a couple of songs have strong dancefloor potential and would easily keep people moving during any dark alternative party.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9b83e2a60a3f259b6cbae4f1657c6ff1ff797a1","amp;dn":"Black+Tower+-+Inerya+-+dark+electro+industrial+ebm+goth+gothic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9b83e2a60a3f259b6cbae4f1657c6ff1ff797a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,184,62,42,96,163,242,89,182,203,174,79,22,87,198,255,31,247,151,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

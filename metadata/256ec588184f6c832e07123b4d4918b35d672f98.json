Fest tells and interprets the extraordinary story of\na man's and a nation's rise from impotence to absolute power,\nas Germany and Hitler, from shared premises, entered into\ntheir covenant. He shows Hitler exploiting the resentments\nof the shaken, post-World War I social order and seeing\nthrough all that was hollow behind the appearance of power,\nat home and abroad. Fest reveals the singularly penetrating\npolitician, hypnotizing Germans and outsiders alike with the\nscope of his projects and the theatricality of their\npresentation. Fest also, perhaps most importantly, brilliantly\nuncovers the destructive personality who aimed at and achieved\ndevastation on an unprecedented scale.\n\nHitler\nBy: Joachim Fest\nISBN13: 9788408003762\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 2444","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:256ec588184f6c832e07123b4d4918b35d672f98","amp;dn":"Hitler+by+Joachim+Fest.+EPUB+%28Perseu%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"256ec588184f6c832e07123b4d4918b35d672f98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,110,197,136,24,79,108,131,46,7,18,59,77,73,24,179,93,103,47,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

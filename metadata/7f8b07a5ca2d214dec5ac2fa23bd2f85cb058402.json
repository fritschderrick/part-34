This is a later workprint of Aladdin, which is very similar to the final film in terms of script, but still unfinished, and full of pencil test animation and storyboards.\n\n   The ending is a bit different, as the Genie reveals himself to be the Peddler from the beginning of the film, who's been telling us the story the whole time. This is very brief, though!\n\n   As in the early workprint, music from &quot;Scheherezade&quot; by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov is used when Jasmine is about to get her hand chopped off at the market ... This is one of many scenes that are clearly inspired by Richard Williams' unfinished film The Thief and the Cobbler (which often used the same music, and had a notable hand-chopping scene).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f8b07a5ca2d214dec5ac2fa23bd2f85cb058402","amp;dn":"Aladdin+Disney+Unfinished+Workprint+1992","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f8b07a5ca2d214dec5ac2fa23bd2f85cb058402","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,139,7,165,202,45,33,77,236,90,194,250,35,189,47,133,203,5,132,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

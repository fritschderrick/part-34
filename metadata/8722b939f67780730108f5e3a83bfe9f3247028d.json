Significant advantages are observed in aspects such as:\r\nâ€¢\tAppreciable reduction in installation time, which takes 15 minutes with a DVD disk or USB flash drive. Time savings also occurred when reformatting a PC with a clean installation of MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ®, along with the additional programs; requiring less than 2 minutes and 15 clicks to complete the installation;\r\nâ€¢\tSignificant increase in processing speed;\r\nâ€¢\tEnhanced security;\r\nâ€¢\tGreater stability with fewer crashes and/or system reboots;\r\nâ€¢\tImproved performance even when installed on older computers;\r\nâ€¢\tUser interface, whose menus, icons, shortcuts, toolbar, taskbar and default configuration are reorganized, thus making computers much more interactive and user friendly;\r\nâ€¢\tSimplified, more intuitive operating system resources reduce time learning for users.\r\n\r\nRafael Jacob Galapo Rosenthal is a Human/Computer Interaction (HCI) developer.                              \r\nSend e-mail toor fill out the survey and submit your ideas as to how RafaWay for WindowsÂ® Optimized can be improved.

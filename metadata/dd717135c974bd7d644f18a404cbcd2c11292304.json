Applications built on this SDK interact \nand communicate with Bopup Communication Server (IM server software) \nthat must be installed as a server-side part of the instant messaging \nsystem. \n\nBopup IM Client SDK provides functions for connecting and establishing \nIM session with the communication server, sending/receiving personal \nand group instant messages, receiving urgent and high-priority tasks \nfrom the server, managing user's contacts, receiving presence status \nupdates within the Contact List. This SDK supports various \nauthentication methods to autorize users on the IM server: Simple, \nWindows Authentication (SSPI) and using Private login and password \ncredentials entered by a end-user. \n\nProvided functionality and supported features:\n\n* Secure and Private Communication\nAll transmitted messages are encrypted with strong encryption algorithms \nbased on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and CAST-128 algorithms. That \nis the first and primary way to make corporate and business IM safe and \nsecure. \n\n* Authentication Modes \nVarious modes to authenticate and authorize users with the IM server are \nsupported. Choose the best way for your corporate and business \ninfrastructure from the available authentication modes: Simple, Windows \nAuthentication (SSPI) and Private login/password. \n\n* Messaging Groups \nThe centralized management of user groups makes it possible to organize \na flexible IM structure with a list of assigned groups and send / \nreceive-only permissions set for each user. \n\n* User Presence Status \nSee the current status of each user in your Contact List, i.e. Online, \nAway, Offline (Not available).

Offline messages are stored on \nthe IM server and automatically delivered to the recipient when he goes \nonline. \n\n* Centralized Notification \nReceive notifications and urgent messages from the IM server and stay \nupdated on any events and information. These messages are automatically \nsent by the server on the scheduled time and at the specified intervals. \n\n* Message Logging &amp; Archiving \nBrowse, search and view the entire message archives on the IM server. \nPrint information for any period and for any person. \n\n\n\nRequirements and Restrictions\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis SDK requires Bopup Communication Server installed and used as an IM \nserver to provide instant messaging features and functions. Applications \nbuilt using this toolkit depend on 45-day trial of the communication \nserver during which only 10 concurrent connections are supported.\n\nFor more information about Bopup Communication Server please visit \nproduct page at http://www.bopup.com/products/server/\n\n\n\n========================================================================\nCopyright (C) 2000-2012 B Labs.

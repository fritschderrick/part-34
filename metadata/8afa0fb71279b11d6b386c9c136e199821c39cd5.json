Now, this classic is being republished in a completely revised edition, broken down into four volumes to accommodate new developments and to reorganize the material in the most accessible way. In Volume 1, the authors present theories and techniques to dissect games of varied structures and formats in order to develop winning strategies. The irreverent yet highly effective style of the book, as reflected in some of the reviews, makes reading a profitable pleasure. The inclusion of many examples helps the reader to put the mathematical analysis to immediate use.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8afa0fb71279b11d6b386c9c136e199821c39cd5","amp;dn":"Winning+Ways+for+Your+Mathematicaays%2C+Second+Edition%2C+Vol.+1+%287S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8afa0fb71279b11d6b386c9c136e199821c39cd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,250,15,183,18,121,177,29,107,56,108,156,19,110,25,152,33,195,156,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

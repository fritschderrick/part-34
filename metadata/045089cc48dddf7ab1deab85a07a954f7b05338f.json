The explanation for this can be found in their British, Beatles inspired psych sound, including heavily layered and lush orchestration, which was unique for a U.S. band of the day.\n\nThe group formed in 1967 and included Jack Dalton (guitar), Gary Montgomery (piano), Chuck Blackwell (drums), Rob Edwards (lead guitar) and Carl Radle (bass). They signed to Dot Records and released their first 45 later that year, which includes the awesome Ã¢â‚¬ËœBrother LouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Love ColonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ b/w Ã¢â‚¬ËœLovinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nIn 1968, they issued their debut, self titled LP which definitely has its moments in the outstanding Ã¢â‚¬ËœLove HealsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœRather Be MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and of course, the loony Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brother LouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which was later covered by the Moon. In 1969, they issued a follow up LP titled Ã¢â‚¬ËœAtmosphereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, but only Dalton and Montgomery are credited on the record. One highlight off this album is the light and breezy Ã¢â‚¬ËœYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re HighÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nAfter the band broke up in late 1969, Radle went on to play in Delaney &amp; Bonnie and, shortly afterward, Derek &amp; the Dominoes, as well as with J.J. Cale and Eric Clapton. Chuck Blackwell also achieved some renown in the early 70s by playing with Leon Russell, Joe Cocker, Taj Mahal, Freddie King, and other artists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:045089cc48dddf7ab1deab85a07a954f7b05338f","amp;dn":"Colours+-+Atmosphere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"045089cc48dddf7ab1deab85a07a954f7b05338f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,80,137,204,72,221,223,122,177,222,171,133,160,122,149,79,123,5,51,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

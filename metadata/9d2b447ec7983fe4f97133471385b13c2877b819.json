The Picori, also called Minish, are a race of tiny creatures that bestowed a young boy with a green garment, a sword, and a shining golden light many years before the game is set. There are three types of Minish: Town, Forest, and Mountain.\nThe quest begins when Link is chosen by the king of Hyrule to seek the help of the Picori after Vaati had petrified Princess Zelda. Link was chosen because only children can see the Picori. On the voyage he rescues Ezlo, a strange being resembling a green cap with a bird-like head, who joins him and can make Link shrink to the size of the Minish. \n\n=============\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d2b447ec7983fe4f97133471385b13c2877b819","amp;dn":"The+Legend+of+Zelda%3A+The+Minish+Cap+%5B.GBA+ROM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d2b447ec7983fe4f97133471385b13c2877b819","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,43,68,126,199,152,63,228,249,113,51,71,19,133,177,60,40,119,184,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

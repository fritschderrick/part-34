(air!air!) - 2 Albums - 2006-2007\n\noro!oro! (air!air!) is one of the projects by Laurynas Jukonis - Lithuanian post-industrial, darkwave and ambient music artist.  Aliases of Laurynas Jukonis are: GirnÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â³ GiesmÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€s, Nulis, oro!oro!, Svaixt.\n\n---\n\noro!oro! - Ilgesio Rubikonai (Rubicons of Nostalgia; 2006; mp3 VBR; avg. 160 kb/s)\n\nLabel:\tAutarkeia\nCountry:\tLithuania\nReleased:\tDec 2006\nGenre:\t Electronic\nStyle:\tAmbient\nCredits:\tComposed By - Laurynas Jukonis\n\noro!oro! - what is it? Is it the whoop of wonder full of charm and childishness beholding the transparent golden autumnal miracles? Or, are these the agony grips burning the throat and opening the last moment brimming with unbearable longing? This psychedelic code of multiple meanings has something eternal and deeply overt. Laurynas Jukonis, the master of the Lithuanian post-industrial, opens a new sonic structure and aesthetics that transcend the framework of GIRNÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â² GIESMÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€œS project. The new project oro!oro! and its first album ilgesio rubikonai (Rubicons of Nostalgia) are undoubtedly among the most advanced musical works of the Lithuanian author revealing the accuracy and the subtlety of painting of complex and deep human emotions with the help of electronic sound. Particularly lucid and melancholic music of the album ilgesio rubikonai (Rubicons of Nostalgia), which may be classified as extremely refined ambient, transfers the audience into the masterfully highlighted and poetic visions experienced by personalities searching for the meaning of existence when the autumn in closing in. The autumn is the transformation of the nature bringing in the processes of ageing, decline and, at the same time, maturity into the whole of existence. The album promises a lonely but adventurous journey into the sorrowful landscapes of nature, cities and soul. The electronic sound helps the author to materialize the sense of nostalgia and create an immortal hymn for the period of golden autumn and the personality contemplating it. The oro!oro! album ilgesio rubikonai (Rubicons of Nostalgia) is among the most beautiful and deep ambient pieces reflecting the extremely complex ratio of human emotions and the existence. This new sound of ambient can surely be titled philosophical ambient.\n\nTracklisting:\n1 \t  \tGervÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€s Palieka Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â iaurÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€s Namus (Cranes Leaving Their Northern Home)\n2 \t  \tBlyÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡kÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â«s Sapno Verpetai (Pale Vortexes Of The Dream)\n3 \t  \tGelsvi Pabaigos Spinduliai (Daffodil Rays Of The End)\n4 \t  \tIlgesio Rubikonai (Rubicons Of Nostagia)\n5 \t  \tÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â iaurinÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€ Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â½vaigÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾dÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€ - Nemigos SaulÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€ (Northern Star - Sun Of Insomnia)\n6 \t  \tNuoÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡irdÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â«s LaiÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡kai IÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ AuksinÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€s Tremties (Sincere Letters From The Golden Exile)\n7 \t  \tAtÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡alÃƒâ€žÃ¢â€žÂ¢ PaukÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡Ãƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½iÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â³ Lizdai (Chill Bird Nests)\n8 \t  \tDargana (Foul Weather)\n\n*\n\noro!oro! - Prarastos Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â½iemos (Lost Winters; 2007; mp3 CBR; 320 kb/s)\n\nLabel:\tAutarkeia\nCountry:\tLithuania\nReleased:\t2007\nGenre:\tElectronic\nStyle:\tIndustrial, Ambient \n\nThe pioneer of Lithuanian post industrial and the composer of GirnÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â³ GiesmÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€s continues his experiments with sonic impact on human mood. After recording one of the most solid ambient albums ilgesio rubikonai (rubicons of nostalgia), dedicated to the complex relation of the seeking personality and autumn, Laurynas embarked on the investigation of winter phenomenon. It resulted in the new oro!oro! album prarastos Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾iemos providing the audience with a translucent, modest and refined ambient masterpiece conveying very precisely the deepest aspects of winter: limitless cleanliness, transparency, serenity and the recreation of existence. prarastos Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾iemos album embodies the natural ending of the natureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cycle, its esoteric aura, while the motifs of looping music generate remarkably fresh and spacious feel that mesmerises, soothes and makes one dream. The music of the album is also special in that no electronic means were used for its recording. Ambient sounds are produced by harmonica, guitar and archaic zither, which lifts the sound quality of oro!oro! into the entirely new aesthetic level.\n\nTracklisting:\n1 \t  \tSkaidrÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â«s RamybÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€s GÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€lynai (16:43)\n2 \t  \tPilki Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â erkÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡no Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â eÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡Ãƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€liai - SustingÃƒâ€žÃ¢â€žÂ¢ SutemÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â³ MiraÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ai (7:45)\n3 \t  \tPrarastos Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â½iemos, DainuojanÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ios PÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â«gos (18:48)\n4 \t  \tSpeige Garuojanti AuÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ra (7:28)\n\nKeywords: Laurynas Jukonis, experimental, darkwave, dark ambient, industrial, electronic, underground, Autarkeia, Lithuania, oro!oro!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f96efa23bae0f0571fe7bb431e8de4908acd4a8a","amp;dn":"oro%21oro%21+%28air%21air%21%29+-+2+Albums+-+2006-2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f96efa23bae0f0571fe7bb431e8de4908acd4a8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,110,250,35,186,224,240,87,31,231,187,67,30,141,228,144,138,205,74,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

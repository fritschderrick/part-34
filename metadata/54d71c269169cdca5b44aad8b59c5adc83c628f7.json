With a sound that falls somewhere in between Chunk! No, Captain Chunk! and New Found Glory, the band issued their debut EP, Bear Sides, independently in 2013. The group's 2014 full-length When Nothing Goes Right, Go Left! caught the attention of Victory Records, who signed the band in 2015. Abandoned by Bears' label debut, Years Ahead, dropped in early 2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54d71c269169cdca5b44aad8b59c5adc83c628f7","amp;dn":"Abandoned+by+Bears+-+The+Years+Ahead+%282016%29+%5B16.44+CD+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54d71c269169cdca5b44aad8b59c5adc83c628f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,215,28,38,145,105,205,202,91,68,170,216,181,156,90,220,131,198,40,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

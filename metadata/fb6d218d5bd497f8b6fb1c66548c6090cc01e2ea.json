Following the environmental issues raised by the groundbreaking series, it asks why so many species are threatened and how can they be protected in the future.\n\nSaving Species\nMany of the creatures featured in Planet Earth are endangered so do we face an extinction crisis? Saving Species asks the experts if there really is a problem, looks at the reasons behind the declining number of particular animals and questions how we choose which species we want to conserve.\n\n\n\nInto The Wilderness\nPollution, climate change and a growing human population are all putting pressure on Earth&amp;#039;s wildernesses including the Bialowieza forest, the Gobi desert &amp; the Arctic tundra. So how much of the planet is wilderness? And why should we care? Into The Wilderness explores why these uninhabited expanses are important for our survivalas well as that for all creatures on the planet.\n\n\n\nLiving Together\nThe history of conservation throws up some interesting ideas as we look to the future of an ever more populated planet. How can conversation fit into this new world driven by economics and development? Living Together looks at the challenges facing conservation in the 21st Century and looks at the role of religion in promoting a moral and ethical approach to the world we live in.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec:XviD\nVideo Bitrate: ~1470 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x400\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 192 kbps\nAudio Channels: 2\nRunTime Per Part: ~58:00\nNumber Of Parts: 3\nPart Size: ~700Mb\nSource: DVD\nRipped by eazbak","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb6d218d5bd497f8b6fb1c66548c6090cc01e2ea","amp;dn":"BBCanet+Earth+The+Future+3of3+Living+Together+XviD+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb6d218d5bd497f8b6fb1c66548c6090cc01e2ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,109,33,141,91,212,151,248,182,251,28,102,84,140,96,144,204,1,226,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

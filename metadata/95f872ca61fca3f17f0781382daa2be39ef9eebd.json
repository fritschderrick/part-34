Especially now that she senses someone has been watching her ever since she saw the murder. But when Caro walks in the door, her own uncanny skills tell her these aren't ordinary men...especially Damien Keller, who, surprisingly enough, is the first person to believe her.\n\nOnce a Persian mage, Damien is drawn to Caro in a way that no woman has ever attracted him. The magic glimmering within this mortal witch calls to his own, and the need to possess Caro drives him, until it's all-consuming. The vampire can fight it...or he can save her, teach her and damn himself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95f872ca61fca3f17f0781382daa2be39ef9eebd","amp;dn":"Claimed+by+the+Immortal+%28The+Cl+-+Lee%2C+Rachel.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95f872ca61fca3f17f0781382daa2be39ef9eebd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,248,114,202,97,252,163,241,127,7,129,56,45,170,43,227,158,249,238,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

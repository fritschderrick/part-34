The band expands on &quot;Cavern&quot; well into the 13-minute mark, a song that is usually about four minutes long in concert.\nThis would be the last Phish concert until their return to Europe in July.\n\nDisc one\n&quot;The Oh Kee Pa Ceremony&quot; (Anastasio) - 2:23\n&quot;You Enjoy Myself&quot; (Anastasio) - 25:53\n&quot;Theme from the Bottom&quot; (Anastasio, Fishman, Gordon, Marshall, McConnell) - 10:35\n&quot;McGrupp and the Watchful Hosemasters&quot; (Anastasio, Marshall) -10:28\n\nDisc two\n&quot;Bathtub Gin&quot; (Anastasio, Goodman) - 11:25\n&quot;Cities&quot; (Byrne) - 10:36\n&quot;Sparkle&quot; (Anastasio, Marshall) - 4:25\n&quot;Split Open and Melt&quot; (Anastasio) - 11:58\n&quot;Down with Disease&quot; (Anastasio, Marshall) - 16:30\n\nDisc three\n&quot;Ya Mar&quot; (Ferguson) - 14:19\n&quot;Prince Caspian&quot; (Anastasio, Marshall) - 11:20\n&quot;Maze&quot; (Anastasio, Marshall) - 8:05\n&quot;Shafty&quot; (Anastasio, Fishman, Gordon, Marshall, McConnell) - 5:04\n&quot;Possum&quot; (Holdsworth) - 8:23\n&quot;Cavern&quot; (Anastasio, Herman, Marshall) - 12:57\n&quot;Bold as Love&quot; (Hendrix) - 6:41\n\nNotes: This show included the debut of Shafty, which was then briefly teased by Mike and Trey in Possum. Disease, Maze, and Possum were unfinished. The funky jam in between Possum and Cavern featured some stage banter from Trey about the funk jams the band had been playing. Accordingly, Cavern was played in a slower, funkier manner than usual and included some of the older, alternate lyrics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:329bdd87a3601a4fe0abf6762ac6def071d866fb","amp;dn":"Phish+-+1998-04-05+-+Providence+Civic+Center+%28Archival+Release%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"329bdd87a3601a4fe0abf6762ac6def071d866fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,155,221,135,163,96,26,79,224,171,246,118,42,198,222,240,113,216,102,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

He has been a member of the Justice League, R.E.B.E.L.S. and Seven Soldiers of Victory. Adam Strange was created by Gardner Fox and Mike Sekowsky, first appearing in Showcase #17.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e91a0df7d6fb91c3266d42d2722eeb90d605f1e","amp;dn":"Adam+Strange+Comics+%281990-2005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e91a0df7d6fb91c3266d42d2722eeb90d605f1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,145,160,223,125,111,185,28,50,102,212,45,39,34,238,185,13,96,95,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

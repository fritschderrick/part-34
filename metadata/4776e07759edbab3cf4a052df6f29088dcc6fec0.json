Your national law may provide civil or criminal sanctions even for infringements of copyright law for non-commercial purposes\\&quot;.\nthe same is true if you are in the usa, uk, germany, poland, etc.\n\nfor a while i was told and believed you could only get in via bulgarian proxies.  Yes it does work but there are no automated bg proxies and very few overused manual proxies.\n\nwhat i found out recently was that you can log in from hungary, macedonia, columbia, nigeria(i think) kyrigstan, khasakstan and a whole lot of \\&quot;east to central\\&quot; euro nations plus an \nassortemnt of other non-g10 like or non-neo-lierabeske nation states.  \n\n\n2 good websites for manual proxy servers.  if one doesn\\'t work try the next.\n\nnntime.com\n\nwww.xroxy.com\n\nif you can\\'t figure out how to use manual proxy servers, then search for public proxy servers and you will find some sites.  be warned - you must click buttons IF page doesn\\'t load\nproperly, like enable java or whatever.  \n\nsearch srtings like \\&quot;fresh COUNTRY NAME proxies\\&quot; / ie fresh hungarian proxies or \\&quot;lastest COUNRTY NAME proxy servers\\&quot; wil get tons of good sites.\n\nif u r like me, then u only use proxies to d/l stuff from (ILLEGALLY BLOCKED WEBSITES: AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED) arenabg.com /0.arenabg.com or to annoy SPIES like google and others.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4776e07759edbab3cf4a052df6f29088dcc6fec0","amp;dn":"arenabg.com.proxies.explained","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4776e07759edbab3cf4a052df6f29088dcc6fec0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,118,224,119,89,237,186,179,207,74,5,45,246,242,144,136,220,198,254,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

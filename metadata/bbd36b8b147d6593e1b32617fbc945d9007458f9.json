When US forces suffered \nhumiliation in the infamous Blackhawk Down incident they where \nsoon withdrawn and the country increasingly regarded as a no-go-\narea even by humanitarian organisations. \n\nThese 3 documentaries from the British 'Channel 4' paint a vivid \nand at times very disturbingly graphic image of the civil strife. \n\nApart from the almost usual fighting between the local warlords a \nnew force has risen, the Union of Islamic Courts, to compete in the \nstruggle for power. After an invasion by Ethiopian forces in 2006 \nwarlords once again reign in the Somali capital Mogadishu. Countries \nlike Britain are paying to maintain their rule even though reports \nspeak of torture and holding to ransom by government officials. \n\nKenya-born Aidan Hartley explores the situation in Mogadishu: \n\n1. AL-QAEDA'S NEW HAVEN (2005, 25 minutes) \n2. HEARTS, MINDS &amp; HOLY WAR (2006, 25 minutes)\n3. WARLORDS NEXT DOOR?

Dave and Roy sing us into Dave reminiscing on his road to get verified, the crew offers Dave gifts, we find out Dave got busted jerking off, see a #TBT video, and hear from Shock Jock Robot. Weâ€™re treated to a conga line, watch Bobo bomb at Citi Field and get a second chance, Roy tells us about his buddy Keith Richards, Flutesy plays her mystery song, we hear people hate the ESDS reaction video, do a little Davey Mac Q&amp;A, and are treated to another ditty because damn itâ€™s been a real fine day","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37e70ddd3cc0f60ae99bf335c0d415863f550bd7","amp;dn":"East+Side+Dave+Show+2016-09-06","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37e70ddd3cc0f60ae99bf335c0d415863f550bd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,231,13,221,60,192,246,10,233,155,243,53,192,212,21,134,63,85,11,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

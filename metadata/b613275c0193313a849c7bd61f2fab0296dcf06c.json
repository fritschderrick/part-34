After presenting \nintroductory information on protocols and standards, the course covers the components and services within TCP/IP. The central protocols of TCP/IP are examined with emphasis on their purpose. That is, what need do they fulfill in the big picture of node-to-node communication? The course introduces user- and administrator-level programs through hands-on lab exercises. Students also examine static and dynamic routing through a series of labs.\n\nCOURSE OUTLINE\n\n1.

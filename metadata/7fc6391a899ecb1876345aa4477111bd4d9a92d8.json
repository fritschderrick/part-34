Each has witnessed the rapid transformation of our agriculture into an industrial model, and confronted the consequences: food contamination, environmental pollution, depletion of natural resources, and morbid obesity. Forging healthier, sustainable alternatives, they offer a practical vision for a future of our food and our planet.\n\nAmong several main characters, FRESH features urban farmer and activist, Will Allen, the recipient of MacArthurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2008 Genius Award; sustainable farmer and entrepreneur, Joel Salatin, made famous by Michael PollanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book, The OmnivoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dilemma; and supermarket owner, David Ball, challenging our Wal-Mart dominated economy.\nFRESH Details\n\nTotal running time: 72 minutes\nProduction Year: 2009\n\nProduced and Directed by: ana Sofia joanes\nEdited by: Mona Davis\nDirector of Photography: Valery Lyman\nMusic: David Majzlin\nSound Design: Eric Milano\nMixing: Tom Paul\nPoster Design: Seltzer Studio Graphics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fc6391a899ecb1876345aa4477111bd4d9a92d8","amp;dn":"Fresh+-+The+Movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fc6391a899ecb1876345aa4477111bd4d9a92d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,198,57,26,137,158,203,24,118,52,90,164,71,113,17,189,77,154,146,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The Martons have written Tony a surefire hit... or so they think, until they fall under the charms of writer/director/producer/actor du jour, Jeffrey Cordova (Jack Buchanan) and their lighthearted musical comedy is turned into some kind of freaky Faustian opera. Jeffrey also ropes the famous French ballet-dancer Gabrielle Gerard (Cyd Charisse) and her choreographer boyfriend Paul Byrd (James Mitchell) into the production, but Tony and Gabrielle start off with each other on the wrong foot--almost literally so, since Tony is primarily a hoofer feeling his age, and Gabrielle a ballet star in her prime. They don't seem to match at all, from age to temperament, right down to dancing style. When Tony and Gabrielle finally come to an understanding, however, it's evident their musical is headed for a critical drubbing, and their hint of a romantic relationship thrown into doubt by Paul's annoyance that Gaby doesn't want to leave the show with him. The rest of the film works at resolving this double impasse.\n\nRip Specs:\n\nGeneral           : The.Band.Wagon.1953.720p.HQTV.x264.AC3.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 4 449 Kbps\nLength            : 3.49 GiB for 1h 52mn 16s 397ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 3 999 Kbps\nAspect            : 986 x 720 (1.369) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 448 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : es\n\nText #1           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #2           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : fr\n\nText #3           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : it\n\nText #4           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : pt\n\nText #5           : UTF-8\nLanguage          : pt\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045537/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045537/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca28264bb1304f2cbccc5fc6762617b96f7d1dbb","amp;dn":"The.Band.Wagon.1953.720p.HQTV.x264.AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca28264bb1304f2cbccc5fc6762617b96f7d1dbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,40,38,75,177,48,79,44,188,204,95,198,118,38,23,185,111,125,29,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

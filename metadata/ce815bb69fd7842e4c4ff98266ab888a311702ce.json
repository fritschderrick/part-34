Between her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drug addiction and her sisterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s overbearing nature; Emma seeks shelter within the pages of sappy romance novels. When Emma meets Matt, she think her wish has been granted, seeing him as the prince that she has always dreamed of. At first she finds herself drawn to his dark and strange desires, but the closer they become, the more Emma realizes that there is something horribly wrong with Matt.\n\n\n&quot;This is not a book for everyone. In fact, not even general horror readers may be able to stomach the atmosphere set and presented in Placebo. This is a book for the hardcore horror aficionado who is mildly amused by about 75 percent of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s horror fare and who actively searches for deep, dark, sinister and mysterious plots that might even see Stephen King raise an eyebrow or two.&quot; - Sylvia Cochran, The Deepening ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce815bb69fd7842e4c4ff98266ab888a311702ce","amp;dn":"Paul+Allih+-+Placebo+-+A+Horror+Novel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce815bb69fd7842e4c4ff98266ab888a311702ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,129,91,182,159,215,132,46,76,79,249,130,102,171,136,138,49,23,2,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

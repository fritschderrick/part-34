The song was written by Mars, Philip Lawrence, Ari Levine and Andrew Wyatt, while production was handled by The Smeezingtons. It was released as the third promotional single taken from the album and was released as the second official single.\n&quot;When I Was Your Man&quot; is a soul piano ballad about a pre-fame heartbreak as he regrets a girl that he let get away, expressing his earnest hope that her new man is giving her all the love and attention he was unwilling, or unable to provide when they were together. It received positive reviews from music critics, who praised Mars's vocals and named it a &quot;vulnerable and emotional ballad&quot;. It became an international success in regions such as Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, United Kingdom and the United States, where it topped the charts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcd878e29e165b5660edee061b3aea9f7bd17a85","amp;dn":"Bruno+Mars+-+When+I+Was+Your+Man+-+Transformer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcd878e29e165b5660edee061b3aea9f7bd17a85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,216,120,226,158,22,91,86,96,237,238,6,27,58,234,159,123,209,122,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

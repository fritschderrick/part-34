I am the last\nsupermarket trolley alive. Aloha.\n\nI once bet 500,000 pounds that God existed. I was a nut. Thanks\nto Edgar Malroy I am better now. Really\n\nI was made on the 3rd of November 2022, at 11.30 a.m., in an\nindustrial estate on the outskirts of Chelmsford.\n\nAfter I rolled off the production line I was greeted by a technician\nwith a friendly face. She tapped me on my push-bar and said the first\nwords I ever heard. Which were: Whos a pretty boy then?\nWhich was how I discovered my gender.\n\nFor a time I considered the technician with the friendly face a\nmother of sorts.\nWe all did I suppose.\n\nThe technician who said the first words I ever heard and tapped\nme on my push-bar was called Kitty Fitzgerald. She earned 9 pounds\n50 an hour in 2022. She was not incredibly enthusiastic about my\nexistence. She said Whos a pretty boy then? casually, as if\nshe was uninterested. In fact, she couldnt have cared less.\n\nThe reason why Kitty Fitzgerald couldnt have cared less about me\nor the other fifty trolleys she looked after was this: three weeks\nearlier she had come home to find her husband having sex with the\nfamily vacuum cleaner.\nThey got a divorce and she never spoke to the vacuum cleaner again.\n\n=======\n\nAlternative downloads :\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayfiles.com/file/4wp7/y2U976/Scepticism_Inc_-_Bo_Fowler.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayfiles.com/file/4wp7/y2U976/Scepticism_Inc_-_Bo_Fowler.pdf&lt;/a&gt;\n\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:B12545708806C9B8D950AE3CA9222A1803312D86\n\n========\n\nEnjoy one of my all time favourite reads.\n\nShare it with everyone and don't forget to\nput your money where your metaphysics are on Bo's site.\n\nPeace.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b12545708806c9b8d950ae3ca9222a1803312d86","amp;dn":"Scepticism+Inc+-+Bo+Fowler+-+1998+-+%5BPDF%5D+-+GCJM+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b12545708806c9b8d950ae3ca9222a1803312d86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,37,69,112,136,6,201,184,217,80,174,60,169,34,42,24,3,49,45,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It\npublished much light &quot;frothy&quot; fantasy in its early years, but by the late\n1940's was printing much the same material as its companion, only more\nfantastic in vein. At one stage in the very early 1940's it nearly ceased.\nSome novels around 1950-1951 were of importance, but the story standard\ndropped considerably in its last year. Its position as companion to Amazing\nwas taken by Fantastic.\n\nThis torrent contains 124 issues of the 129 published, along with two issues of the UK edition in cbr/cbz format.

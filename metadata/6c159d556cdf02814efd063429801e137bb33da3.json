And the man who would sire the King of the Britons.\n\nFrom the trials of boyhood to the new cloak of adult responsibility, we see Uther with fresh eyes. He will travel the length of the land, have adventures, and, through fate or tragedy, fall in love with the one woman he must not have. Uther is a compelling love story and, like the other books in the Camulod Chronicles, a version of the legend that is more realistic than anything that has been available to listeners before.\n\nÃ‚Â©2001 Aquilifer Holdings Ltd.; (P)2013 \nProduct Details\nListening Length: 37 hours and 21 minutes\nProgram Type: Audiobook\nVersion: Unabridged\nPublisher: Audible, Inc.\nRelease Date: August 20, 2013\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c159d556cdf02814efd063429801e137bb33da3","amp;dn":"Uther+Camulod+Chronicles+-+Book+7+%5BAudioBook%5D+-+sum1_here","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c159d556cdf02814efd063429801e137bb33da3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,21,157,85,108,223,2,129,78,253,6,52,41,128,30,19,123,179,61,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

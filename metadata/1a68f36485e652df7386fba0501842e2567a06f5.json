Throughout the 1980s, the band accumulated numerous hit songs in Canada and the United States, earning four multi-platinum albums and selling millions of records. After being rejected by many American record labels they signed with Columbia/CBS Records Canada and began recording their first album March 20, 1980 with Mike Reno on lead vocals, Paul Dean as the guitarist, Scott Smith as the bassist, Doug Johnson on keyboards and Matt Frenette on drums. The band's hit singles, particularly &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot; and &quot;Working for the Weekend&quot;, have become arena rock staples and are still heard on many classic rock radio stations across the United States and Canada. They are currently based in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nThe band got its start in Calgary, Alberta, Canada  when Mike Reno (formerly of the band Moxy) was introduced to Paul Dean (formerly of the band Streetheart) at the Refinery Night Club. Dean was rehearsing a new band in a warehouse with a friend of Reno's and Mike had stopped by to jam. Over the next few weeks Reno and Dean wrote songs together on guitar and drums. Meanwhile, Doug Johnson, who was working with another band at the time, joined the band and Loverboy was born.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a68f36485e652df7386fba0501842e2567a06f5","amp;dn":"Loverboy+-+When+It%5C%27s+Over++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a68f36485e652df7386fba0501842e2567a06f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,104,243,100,133,230,82,223,115,134,251,160,80,24,66,226,86,122,6,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It's a seemless \nrecording meaning there are no cuts or edits between tracks. \n\nThere is a very slight cut at the end of disc one, but it's right at the \nend of Gold Dust Woman,no vocals are cut. There is also a slight cut in at \nthe beginning of disc two, but again no vocals are sliced off.\n\nI have no info on who taped the show, but a big thanks to everyone responsible \nfor getting this tape transferred - it's a really great sounding show.\n\nArtwork included\n\nLineage: SBD &gt; ? &gt; Cassette &gt; wav &gt; cdr &gt; eac &gt;wav &gt; flac Level 6\n \n01 Welcome\n02 Say You Love Me\n03 Monday Morning\n04 Dreams\n05 Oh Well\n06 Rhiannon\n07 Oh Daddy\n08 Never Going Back Again\n09 Landslide\n10 Over My Head\n11 Gold Dust Woman\n12 You Make Loving Fun\n13 I'm So Afraid\n14 Go Your Own Way\n15 World Turning\n16 Blue Letter\n17 Second Hand News\n18 The Chain\n19 Songbird","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11d4b4ca0b3088bade3c19bc2d9502f084965f79","amp;dn":"Fleetwood+Mac+-+1977-05-21+-+Nashville%2C+TN++SBD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11d4b4ca0b3088bade3c19bc2d9502f084965f79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,212,180,202,11,48,136,186,222,60,25,188,45,149,2,240,132,150,95,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

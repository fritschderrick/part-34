He is a devout man with a problem - membership is down and he lacks the funds to keep his synagogue open. Things are looking very bleak, and he has grown progressively more cynical and bitter with the passage of time.\n\nJust as he is on the verge of quitting, he receives some intriguing news. An estranged member of his congregation has died and left the rabbi a significant amount of money. A blessing? Or the start of something far more sinister? Can Rabbi Stone just accept the money and move on, or will his conscience get the better of him? Step into his shoes as he travels all over Manhattan in his attempt to uncover the truth.\n\nFeatures rabbinical conversation methods, a unique method of fighting, a haunting score, and three different endings depending on your moral choices.\n\nThis app has no advertisements","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee20733efbf2464d2124652799fe1a69f33e64e7","amp;dn":"Shivah+v1.1+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee20733efbf2464d2124652799fe1a69f33e64e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,32,115,62,251,242,70,77,33,36,101,39,153,254,26,105,243,62,100,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

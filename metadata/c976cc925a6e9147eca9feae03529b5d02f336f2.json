It was conceived in autumn 2004 by Francesco Zago (formerly of The Night Watch) and Marcello Marinone who wanted to create a band which will play combine RIO and chamber music. As influences they state the following: &quot;Satie, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Cage, Reich, Zappa, Henry Cow, Gentle Giant, King Crimson, Univers Zero&quot;...\n\n...dynamic chamber rock, chamber music, mellow and ponderous parts, some &quot;symphonic prog&quot; parts (there is a mellotron and minimoog), quickly changing rhythms and unusual time signatures, layers of instruments playing different tunes, some quirky tracks which are free-form and more abstract (played mostly by only the classical instruments) and you have the complete freak-out parts where the band goes insane. There is a myriad of styles here and you need many listens to be able to absorb all of it and identify the numerous influences and musical ideas. The sound is rich due to the expanded lineup and the production.&quot;\n-- Assaf Vestin (avestin) / progarchives.com --\n\nAlbums:\n2006 - Labirinto d'acqua\n2010 - Iridule\n\n- more infos and some reviews at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=2811&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=2811&lt;/a&gt;\n- Yugen official website at: ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c976cc925a6e9147eca9feae03529b5d02f336f2","amp;dn":"Yugen+-+Labirinto+d%5C%27acqua+%5B2006%5D%2B+Iridule+%5B2010%5D+-+%28Avant-Prog%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c976cc925a6e9147eca9feae03529b5d02f336f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,118,204,146,90,110,145,71,236,169,254,174,3,82,155,93,2,243,54,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

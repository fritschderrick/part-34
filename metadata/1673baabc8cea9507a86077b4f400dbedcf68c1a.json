Since its release 'The Cream' has been regarded as being one of his finest albums and an essential part of his recorded legacy.  It captures Hooker at the peak of his considerable powers, despite his being in his sixties at the time.  Recorded in September 1977 at 'The Keystone' club in California, Hooker is in blinding form here, fronting a rocking six-piece band and delivering memorable performances of such Hooker classics as 'Tupelo', 'Sugar Mama' and the truly harrowing 'T. B. Sheets'.  This is a definitive cd re-issue of one of this classic Hooker album since this two-cd set includes the original double album in its entirety - previous re-issues have been accommodated on a single cd which has necessitated omitting certain songs and using an edited version of 'Boogie On', the jam used by Hooker as his show's closer, an extended work-out of his first-ever hit, 'Boogie Chillen'.   In addition, this re-issue includes five bonus tracks, including his big hit 'Boom Boom', taken from a live concert Hooker gave in Chicago a few weeks after 'The Cream' session.\n\nDeath, as they say, can be a good career move.  That's a cynical attitude to take toward the passing of one of the blues greatest legends--in fact, one of the greatest legends of American music, ever--but it's hard not to get cynical in the wake of all the reissues and dusted-off old recordings that have hit the shelves in the wake of John Lee Hooker's passing in June 2001.  Still, the aptly named The Cream is worth a listen.  Recorded in Palo Alto in 1977, this live concert recording captures Hooker in a relaxed mood, taking things easy and jamming with the band.  It's a good, solid set, especiallymoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ in its closing number, &quot;Boogie On&quot;, a jamming version of Hooker's classic &quot;Boogie Chillen&quot; that features some nice harp work from Charlie Musselwhite.  While The Cream doesn't threaten the pride of place of Hooker's live Newport recording ( itself recently reissued ), it's very satisfying on its own terms. ~ Genevieve Williams \n\nI really dig this album, as it is so smooth and easy to listen to. Very cool, calm and laid back, throw this album on when your looking for something to calm you down. Stand out tracks include &quot;Louise&quot; &amp; &quot;Bar Room Drinking&quot;. Not the best place to start out on Hooker, but if your are a hooker fan, or love laid back chilled out blues, then this album is worth its weight in gold. ~ juanrod\n\nJohn Lee Hooker - The Cream Disc 2:\n11  Bar Room Drinking (8:15)\n12  Little Girl\n13  Louise\n14  When My First Wife Left Me\n15  Boogie On","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1673baabc8cea9507a86077b4f400dbedcf68c1a","amp;dn":"John+Lee+Hooker+-+The+Cream+D2+%281977%29+%5BBlues%5D%5Bmp3+256%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bsch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1673baabc8cea9507a86077b4f400dbedcf68c1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,115,186,171,200,206,169,80,122,134,7,123,79,64,13,190,220,246,140,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

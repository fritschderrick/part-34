Who built them, how were they built and why? Experts   \n         across Egypt are discovering new information that sheds       \n         light on the Ancient Egyptians' pyramids and how they         \n         evolved. One theory poses that King Sneferu's Bent Pyramid    \n         was not a mistake. Recent discoveries show how the pyramids   \n         evolved from a mound of rocks and sand to flat, rectangular   \n         mastabas, to the pyramid shape, so famously exhibited in      \n         the Great pyramid of Khufu and beyond. Now the archaeology    \n         is being taken a stage further with new technology. The       \n         film shows how the next generation of archaeologists are      \n         finally piecing together the secret pyramid code which        \n          might have been used by the Egyptians.                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                           CTU, ORENJi, 2HD, DHD                       \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.

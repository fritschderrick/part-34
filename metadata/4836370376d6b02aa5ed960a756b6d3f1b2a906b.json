She just knows the school newspaper is the right place for her, but she doesn't have the required experience, and the cute editor-in-chief isn't looking for someone to train. She has to come up with a way to prove herself and nab the one available position on the newspaper staff at Wexburg Academy. London Confidential is a new series where British fashion, friendships, and guys collide, and where an all-American girl learns to love life and live out her faith.\nGenre: young adult\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4836370376d6b02aa5ed960a756b6d3f1b2a906b","amp;dn":"Asking+for+Trouble_+1+%28London+C+-+Byrd%2C+Sandra.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4836370376d6b02aa5ed960a756b6d3f1b2a906b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,54,55,3,118,214,176,42,165,237,150,10,117,107,109,63,27,42,144,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

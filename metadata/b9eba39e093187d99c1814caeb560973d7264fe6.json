But I'll make an exception for Erasure, \nwhich has a great deal more going for it than the vast majority \nof music you're likely to hear the next time you hit the dance floor.\n\nChief among the band's assets is vocalist Andy Bell, who has a \nremarkably rich and passionate voice--but Erasure does not rely on \nBell pure and simple. It is the combination of Bell's vocals, \na bouncy beat, and the often unexpectedly thoughtful and frequently \nbitter lyrics that do the trick. \n\nThe result is a consistent sound that crackles with a sensuous passion, \nand at its best creates one memorable cut after another.\n\nPOP! suffers from the usual failings of every compilation album, \nwhich is to say that it generally goes for the obvious choice even \nwhen a lesser-known selection is clearly superior. But even so, \nit offers a solid overview of Erasure, from the purely danceable to \nthe disquietingly emotional playing against the dancefloor rhythm. \n&quot;Ship of Fools,&quot; &quot;Chains of Love,&quot; and &quot;A Little Respect&quot; are perhaps \n the side of Erasure that are most recognized--but when the selections \nturn to such intense and lyrically sharp selections as &quot;Drama&quot; and \n&quot;Love to Hate You,&quot; you know that you've stumbled into something special.\n\n___________________________________\n\n01.

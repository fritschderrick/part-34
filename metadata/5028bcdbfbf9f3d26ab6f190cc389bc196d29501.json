Prophetic in foresight and universal in scope, this book lays out a path to the peaceful existence of all humans based on the central theme of worshipping the One God.\n\nIt is not surprising therefore that A Message of Peace forms the last work of a man who was destined to lay the foundation for the establishment of peace in this day and age and whose advent was prophesied in all major religions of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€the Promised Messiah and Reformer of the Latter Days. Ã¢â‚¬ËœMy countrymen!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ writes the Promised Messiah, Ã¢â‚¬ËœA religion which does not inculcate universal compassion is no religion at all. Similarly a human being without the faculty of compassion is no human at all.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn Overview of The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community:\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is a dynamic, fast growing international revival movement within Islam. Founded in 1889, it spans over 206 countries with membership exceeding tens of millions. Its current headquarters are in the United Kingdom.\n\nAhmadiyya Muslim Community is the only Islamic organization to believe that the long-awaited Messiah has come in the person of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad(as) (1835-1908) of Qadian.

Joined by brother and co-writer Daniel Creamer, the band is a family of creative free-spirits in pursuit of the high and lofty. Dovetail gives much credence to musical predecessors, and lives in a magic place of sonic discovery. If you are a fan of The Beach Boys, Big Star, or the Byrds you might well connect with this Texas based Band. Dovetail has released two studio albums, Love is War(2010) and Mount Karma(2012). After signing a record deal with the New Jersey based label, Ok!Good Records, Mount Karma is due to re-release in Spring 2013 with new songs, new art, and a limited vinyl pressing. Dovetail won the John Lennon Song Contest in 2012 with the original song Julie.

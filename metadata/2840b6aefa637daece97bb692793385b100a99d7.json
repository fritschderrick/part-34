Determined to break out of this imperfect genetic destiny and fulfil his dreams, Vincent meets Jerome (Jude Law), a `Valid` willing to sell his prime genetic material for cash. \n\nUsing Jerome`s blood, urine, skin and hair samples, Vincent is able to forge a new identity and pursue his goal of a blossoming romance with Irene (Uma Thurman), another `Valid`. However a week before his flight, a Gattaca mission director is brutally murdered and Vincent finds himself pursued by a relentless investigator (Alan Arkin) threatening to expose his counterfeit life and reveal him as `In-valid`, ending his dreams forever. \n\nMore info... \n\nDirector: Andrew Niccol \n\nActor: Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law, Loren Dean, Alan Arkin, Gore Vidal, Xander Berkeley, Elias Koteas, Ernest Borgnine, Tony Shalhoub, Blair Underwood \n\nPAL \n* Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 - Anamorphic Widescreen \n* Run time: 106.00 mins \n* Subtitles: English, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian \n* No. of disks: 1 \n* Producer: Danny DeVito, Michael Shamberg, Stacey Sher \n* Sound format: Dolby Digital 5.1 - English, Dolby Digital 5.1 - Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 - Italian, Surround Sound - English \n\n\nDVD special features \n\nInteractive menus feature choices of: Audio set-up: 2 channel or 5.1 (Dolby Digital), Multiple language subtitles, Scene selections.

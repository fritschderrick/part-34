The third edition of this perennial bestseller continues to be the most modern and authoritative guide in the field. Based on the author's lifetime of experience, the book also incorporates relevant published information from many sources.\n\nUpdated and expanded to reflect new technologies, methods, and materials, the book includes new information on topics such as liquefaction of loose sediments, scour and erosion, archaeological concerns, high-performance steel, ultra-high-performance concrete, steel H piles, and damage from sabotage and terrorism. It features coverage of LNG terminals and offshore wind and wave energy structures. Clearly, concisely, and accessibly, this book steers you away from the pitfalls and toward the successful implementation of principles that can bring your marine and offshore projects to life.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 840 pages\n    * Publisher: CRC Press; 3 edition (March 5, 2007)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0849330521\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0849330520","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19ea435bb84d443e2cfc67f33779472b7dac2ab6","amp;dn":"Construction+of+Marine+and+Offshore+Structures%2C+3rd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19ea435bb84d443e2cfc67f33779472b7dac2ab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,234,67,91,184,77,68,62,44,252,103,243,55,121,71,43,125,172,42,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

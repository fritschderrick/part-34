Background, ethnicity, training and age are not an issue.  Tasting and selections are blind, which I think is brilliant.\n\nThe first seven episodes are the auditions to select the top 30 out of so-many-I-have-no-idea, then the chefs select their teams and mentor them during the kitchen battles and competition where one by one they are eliminatedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and then to the finals.\n\nHealthy with kids as the judges and NO SALT allowed!  Then the individual challenge, dessert with NO SUGAR!\n\nThe chefs are:\nMeir Adoni, executive chef of Ã¢â‚¬ËœCatitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Israel's best restaurant according to the NY Times)\nAssaf Granit, chef and restaurant owner in the shouk in Jerusalem.\nMoshik Rote, executive chef of Ã¢â‚¬ËœSamhoud &amp; PlacesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in Amsterdam and holds two Michelin stars\n\nFile name: Chef Games S01E15 - Healthy Gourmet for Kids 480p IggY.mp4\nFile type: mp4\nSize: 475 MB\n\nVideo\nLength: 01:17:52\nFrame width: 854\nFrame height:  480\nData rate:  787 kbps\nTotal bitrate:  912 kbps\nFrame rate:  25 frames/second\n\nAudio\nBit rate:  125 kbps\nChannels: 2 (stereo)\nAudio sample rate:  44kHz\n\nFirst, apologies: It's a fantastic show in Hebrew without English subtitles.  And even worse, there are hardcoded Hebrew subtitles.  Sorry. Really!  This is all that's available right now.\n\nFigured I'd get it out there even without English.  Maybe I'll do the subtitles myself one day although by the time I finish them I'm sure they'll be available. Either way, maybe you'll enjoy it anyway ... I did. And I promise to get the subtitles up here one way or another. If someone knows where to find the raw Hebrew subtitles, I can get them translated so let me know please.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a395ede201c4e8cbe7a490da187d1c5e16f76e4","amp;dn":"Chef+Games+S01E15+-+Healthy+Gourmet+for+Kids+480p+IggY.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a395ede201c4e8cbe7a490da187d1c5e16f76e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,57,94,222,32,28,78,140,190,122,73,13,161,135,209,197,225,111,118,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

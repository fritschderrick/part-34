By slowing your music, and presenting a detailed spectrogram, Capo lets you hear and see your music like never before. \n\n==It's your music==\n\nNo longer do you have to rely on the musical tastes of others to learn music. Drag songs right from your music collection into Capo to start learning them.\n\n==Detect, and Enter Chords==\n\nFigure out the chords in your music using Capo's sophisticated chord detection routines. Or, enter your own easily using strings like Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbbmaj7Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ or Ã¢â‚¬Ëœf#maj9Ã¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\n==Pitch Adjustment==\n\nCapo lets you adjust the pitch of your songsÃ¢â‚¬â€so you can change their key or fine tune them to match your instrument.\n\n==Music Export==\n\nTake your Capo-adjusted music with you. Export speed- and pitch-corrected audio to your iPod, and play along when and where it's most convenient.\n\n==Tab it Out==!\n\nBy simply drawing atop the spectrogram, Capo will generate tablature automatically for you. It really doesn't get much easier than this!\n\n==Markers==\n\nUse keyboard shortcuts to mark verses, choruses, bridges, and other important points in your songs so you can return to them later.\n\n==Looping=\n\nRepeat difficult sections slowly, playing along with your favorite artist. Speed up gradually as you get better.\n\n==Effects==\n\nCapo lets you modify panning, adjust a 10-band graphic equalizer, and apply vocal reduction to help you isolate the parts of the music you wish to learn.\n\n\n~This torrent is the latest version of Capo 2 for Mac OS X Snow Leopard or higher.

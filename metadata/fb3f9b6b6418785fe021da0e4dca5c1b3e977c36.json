Design variations and embellishments add the personal touch, and can make each design a more challenging project for an experience knitter.Additionally, the small size of the projects in this book makes them ideal to tuck into a purse or tote bag, so that they can be worked on at odd moments during the day when the knitter finds a few free moments","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb3f9b6b6418785fe021da0e4dca5c1b3e977c36","amp;dn":"Stylish+Knits+for+Dogs%3A+36+Projects+to+Knit+in+a+Weekend","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb3f9b6b6418785fe021da0e4dca5c1b3e977c36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,63,155,107,100,24,120,95,224,33,218,14,77,202,92,27,62,151,124,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

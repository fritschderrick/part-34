A raft of problems associated with the true capacities of sticks and the quirkiness of some BIOSs emerged which hopefully V3 addresses. \n\n I have edited all the major posts to incorporate the lessons learnt and will also place a link in the second post to the brief summary below. \n Thanks once again. \n\nVersion Summary: (All versions include the Metro interface) \n\n Blue Pup Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (V1 Released 3rd March 2014 - 575 MB) \n Has a very traditional desktop complete with all icons. \n\n Blue Pup Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (V2 Released 13th March 2014 - 602 MB) \n Starts here: www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=764653#764653 \n Provides an alternate panel desktop, new cosmetics, improved speed and easier navigation. \n\n Blue Pup Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (V3 Released 02nd April 2014 - 323MB) \n Starts here: http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=767134#767134 \n This contains a boot partition specially crafted to deal with difficult BIOSs but will still boot on any kit. The download is smaller and the original partition layout totally changed. \n The expanded image has been reduced to 4GB but the target stick size of 8GB or greater still applies. This deals with 8GB sticks that are actually short of capacity which would not image correctly. \n Minor editing of syslinux.cfg for this to boot may be needed depending on your hardware. \n Choose this version if your BIOS cannot normally boot from a USB stick or if you prefer it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56f95a382b8ff8a4e514593f802b86e1ee2c6f9e","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_Blue_Pup_archive_+26-Mar-2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56f95a382b8ff8a4e514593f802b86e1ee2c6f9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,249,90,56,43,143,248,164,229,20,89,63,128,43,134,225,238,44,111,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

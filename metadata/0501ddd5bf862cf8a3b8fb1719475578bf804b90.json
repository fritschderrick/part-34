He applies a rare scientific rigorousness to his work that makes it stand out among the usual stuff on the net. He is a real asset to the PC enthusiast.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Jeremy Smith, ABIT Computer\n\n&quot;By far the best BIOS Guide there is.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Steven Lynch, HardOCP.com\n\n&quot;The BIOS Optimization Guide is a one-of-a-kind resource that I refer to anybody who wants to tweak their computers to run the best. And I wouldn&amp;#039;t refer others to something I wouldn&amp;#039;t use myself. I&amp;#039;ve referred to the BOG countless times as I upgrade my BIOS or get a new motherboard. The in-depth explanations really let you know what each BIOS option means, and which settings these options yield the highest performance and stability.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Brandom Hum, AllHardwareZone.com\n\n&quot;Adrian knows more about tweaking a BIOS than Bill Gates knows about Windows. Short and sweet: If you own a computer you need to know about the BIOS; and Adrian is flat-out the authority when it comes to understanding, configuring, or tweaking a computer&amp;#039;s BIOS.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Digital Dave, WinOSCentral.com\n\n&quot;The BIOS is the basic inputÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“output system of any computer that defines how the individual parts of the hardware are interacting with each other. Many of the parameters are completely transparent to the user; however, there are others that are user accessible and allow customizing the performance depending on the individual needs and the choice of components in the system. What was a myth-surrounded part of any computer only some 5 years ago has been largely decrypted by now, mostly due to efforts coming from enthusiasts. Any guide like this will offer invaluable help not only as a reference, but also for troubleshooting of personal computers.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Michael Schuette, LostCircuits.com\n\n&quot;If you ever wanted to know what you can do with your BIOS, Adrian has it covered. Being an admirer for more years than I can count, the BIOS Optimization Guide is a fantastic journey into the inner workings of a PC at the root level. It has taught me how to tweak my PC in a safe way and get the most out of my system. Period.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½David Kroll, ExtensionTech.net\n\n&quot;It is the one piece of the system that is powered continuallyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½even when the computer is unplugged. It is the first program that runs on start-up. Without it, no operating system would install. It is the first component that requires configuration. It is the first feature that requires your attention. It is... THE SYSTEM BIOS. The very first procedure to be performed on a newly assembled computer system is to ensure that the system BIOS is up-to-date. This procedure in itself can be clouded in mystery and present some trepidation for the average user. Then comes the Black Art of BIOS configuration. Has the BIOS detected the hardware correctly? Is there some hardware that should remain disabled? What do each of the BIOS settings mean, and more importantly, what do they do? Whether you are planning to build a new system or merely upgrade an old one, it is advisable to have some knowledge of the system BIOS. The Definitive BIOS Guide from Rojak Pot represents one of the most complete resources for BIOS configuration currently available. Check it out!&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Thomas Monk, Accelenation.com\n\n&quot;The BIOS Optimization Guide is a truly useful resource for those looking to get the most out of their systems. I often point people to the BOG to learn more about memory timings and what they mean.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Sean Sinha, OCZ Technology\n\n&quot;95% of all Bios optimizations that I now know I learned from Rojak Pot&amp;#039;s guide. And so did everyone else. If they tell you different, they are not telling the you the truth or they read it on a site that stole the information from his.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Frank Trockel, Trainwrecker.com\n\n&quot;Whether you are an overclocking uber geek or a first-time computer user, Adrian&amp;#039;s BIOS Optimization Guide is a must. I can truthfully say that 90% of what I have learned about BIOS optimization has been through the use of Adrian&amp;#039;s guide. Why else would I refer to him as &amp;#039;The King of the BIOS&amp;#039;?&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Kevin Elliot, Hi-TechReviews.com\n\n&quot;Adrian has done the tech community a great service by making this guide. It has personally saved me time on both repairs and evaluations. With BIOS options as numerous as they are today, it&amp;#039;s wonderful to have a one-stop-source to decipher them all.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Nathan Warawa, GamingIn3D.com\n\n&quot;You know, I couldn&amp;#039;t count the amount of times I&amp;#039;ve referred people to your BIOS Guideelit&amp;#039;s very informative, and saves me the time of explaining why people should disable Video BIOS Shadowing, why Fast Writes isn&amp;#039;t such a big deal for today&amp;#039;s games, and much more.&quot; &quot;Just wanted to say thanks for saving me time and also helping me out. (I learned a lot from it, too!) Keep up the most excellent work.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Matt Burris, 3DGPU.com\n\n&quot;...this isn&amp;#039;t so much a Knowledge base but a labor of love. Not only has this guide had a place in both Titch&amp;#039;s and My Favorites for many years, but I&amp;#039;m really excited to see it still going after many, many years. Well done, Adrian. Keep up the excellent work.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½JohnL, The ModFathers.com\n\n&quot;Adrian Wong of Adrian&amp;#039;s Rojak Pot has been building up his BIOS Guide since late 1999. Today, he hit version 6.0, and the guide is now comprehensive in its scope. It comes highly recommended from me due to the fact that BIOS optimizations can yield positive results in performance and compatibility for everyone. Adrian also goes into far greater detail than even your best motherboard manual and even debunks some &quot;myths&quot; that some manufacturers still propagate.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ryu Connor, Tech-Report.com\n\n&quot;This is one of the most comprehensive and user-friendly guides I have found to date. I was able to do various tweaks with my mem/cpu that increased my overall system performance by about 15%. Many of the BIOS tweaks will depend on your mobo and whether certain options are even available in your BIOS menu. However, I do recommend that even ppl that aren&amp;#039;t familiar with working with the BIOS give it a go with this guide... Really helps to answer all your questions.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½James, TimSoft.com\n\n&quot;Some bookmarks occupy space in my Favorites folder just in case I need such a resource in the future, but others are frequent visits. I can easily see this one being a resource to which I refer often. This site contains very good explanations of the numerous configuration options you see in the BIOS. ...this truly is a link you&amp;#039;ll want to keep around. This one is already sync&amp;#039;ed to my iPaq!&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½LockerGnome.com\n\n&quot;This is the most comprehensive BIOS Guide available. Just about every option in a modern BIOS is explained. The best performance setting is usually pointed out, and the explanations are easy to follow. A must for any overclocker wanna-be.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Tim B., OCWorkbench.com\n\n&quot;I&amp;#039;d like to congratulate the author of the BIOS Optimization Guide. This is absolutely marvelous. I was looking specifically for advanced information on the AGP Aperture Size setting, and you guys have got TEN paragraphs on it.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Sherman, Microsoft Support Services\n\nThe first authoritative guide to optimizing your PC&amp;#039;s BIOS\n\nYour PC&amp;#039;s BIOS enables your software and hardware to work together.

Credited for starting the whole northern European Christian extreme metal scene, Antestor is the only Christian band to have an album released by Cacophonous Records, which has also released records by bands such as Dimmu Borgir, Sigh, and Cradle of Filth. The band's only release on Cacophonous, The Return of the Black Death, proved influential for the Christian black metal movement, and has sold over 10,000 copies.\nIn late 1990s they dubbed their musical style as &quot;sorrow metal&quot; rather than black metal because the black metal movement was publicly affiliated with Satanism in Norway. According to HM Magazine, the progressive elements on the debut album, Martyrium, were possibly ahead of their time in the Norwegian extreme metal scene.\n\nAlbums included:\n\nDespair (1993)\nMartyrium (1994)\nThe Return of the Black Death (1998)\nThe Defeat of Satan (2003)\nDet Tapte Liv (2004)\nThe Forsaken (2005)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f79ad01d8f263c0e794fa55186601ddec0f3076b","amp;dn":"Antestor.Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f79ad01d8f263c0e794fa55186601ddec0f3076b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,154,208,29,143,38,60,14,121,79,165,81,134,96,29,222,192,243,7,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Echo\r\n\r\n+ Digital booklet (m4a version)\r\n\r\nThe Lonely Wild's sophomore effort is not a simple retread of their excellent debut, &quot;The Sun As It Comes.&quot; Chasing White Light shows impressive growth from the spaghetti-western sound that defined their debut. The first track &quot;Snow&quot; is the song most like their previous album, and though this song is excellent, this would have been a very boring follow-up if they didn't shake things up a little bit. This album finds the band members really clicking with one another to capture a sound that blends classic rock with modern indie music.\r\n\r\nThis album was recorded and mixed directly to tape which gives it a wonderful, authentic sound that is not present in a lot of modern, over-produced music. The album also benefits from the addition of strings which adds some great moments of beauty to songs like standout single &quot;Running.' This album has been described as their &quot;Death&quot; album due to the themes present throughout, and while this is an accurate description, the album never gets bogged down in depression. These songs hit you hard in the gut while maintaining some semblance of hopefulness. The title track quickly stakes its place as an instant classic with the slow build of emotion in this 7+ minute epic. If you are not nearly on the verge of tears by the end of the song, you may need to get your heart checked. From beginning to end, this album is a true &quot;album&quot; that functions first and foremost as a singular idea that keeps building and evolving as the album progresses. Do yourself a favor and take the journey this album is offering if you think you are up for it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8703e4b745e9aee19c10f5fda6d3006cec369301","amp;dn":"The+Lonely+Wild+-+Chasing+White+Light+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8703e4b745e9aee19c10f5fda6d3006cec369301","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,3,228,183,69,233,174,225,156,16,245,253,166,211,0,108,236,54,147,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

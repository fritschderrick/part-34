It shows a progressive and graceful evolution from the somewhat innocent, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œclear lineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ style of Upon a Star in the first twenty to thirty pages, to a more detailed look, better adapted to its darker ending.\nThen, as Moebius explains in his afterword, The Gardens of Aedena is also the departure point from which a series of inter-related stories will spring, linking up with earlier works, such as The Airtight Garage, to form the basis of a consistent Moebius universe. This saga is planned to encompass several multi-book cycles, and millions of years in the History of the Moebius multiverse. And it all begins here...\nAnd what better symbol for this conceptual transition, than the not-so-obvious return of Major Grubert as the enigmatic Master Burg! Continuity buffs will also enjoy the painting on the wall of Page 40, which portrays the Airtight Garage itself or rather its ancestor, the asteroid Flower, as it appeared in The Horny Goof.\nThe Gardens of Aedena is a bridge between MoebiusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ past and MoebiusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ future in more ways than one. Hit Man, for instance, an earlier stor very different both in style and content, tums out to have more than a passing connection with the themes of The Aedena Cycie. And so does The Unfaithful Body, a more recent, amusing fantastic voyage. Obviously, the themes that Moebius is now developing were seminally present in his work years ago.\nLast, and perhaps not least, this is the first time that one of MoebiusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ stones is published first in English. Indeed, The Gardens of Aedena has not yet appeared in France, under any form. If you consider that the story was drawn in part in Japan, it may very well be MoebiusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ first, truly international piece of work.\nmarks a transition in MoebiusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ career.\nA milestone on the road to Aedena.&quot;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRemeber to block these pesky swarm saboteurs in your client [updated  IP range!]: 209.249.0.0 - 209.249.255.255\n\nAnd please report any other swarm abuse you observe on this (or any other) torrent.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dd6816054d760b1c5193e68d43a2ffbe7842efc","amp;dn":"Moebius+5+%28Epic%29+-+The+gardens+of+Aedena+%5BCBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dd6816054d760b1c5193e68d43a2ffbe7842efc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,214,129,96,84,215,96,177,197,25,62,104,212,58,47,251,231,132,46,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

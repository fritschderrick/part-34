It is a spacey symphonic rock trip into outer space, dominated by Mellotron, string synth, and other synthesizers, with supporting use of guitars, bass, and drums.\n\nThe album is consistently featured in progarchives among the top five progressive rock albums of 1978, and considered &quot;Essential: a masterpiece of progressive rock music&quot;.\nBased on the growing science fiction trend, the concept for the album was that, 10.000 years after mankind's self-destruction, a man and a woman travelling in space return to Earth to repopulate it. The tone of the lyrics is of contemplation over mankind's past mistakes and future hopes. Cid's musical style on the record is very similar to the French take on symphonic rock with lots of string synths, Mellotron and a very simple melodic style. Lyrics are sung in native Portuguese. Most of the songs, influenced by a sort of mix combining The Moody Blues and Pink Floyd psychedelia, were composed by Cid, some of them with the help of guitar player Mike Sergeant and drummer Ramon Galarza.\n\n\n1. &quot;O ÃƒÅ¡ltimo Dia na Terra&quot; (JosÃƒÂ© Cid)\t4:21\n2. &quot;O Caos&quot; (Manuel Lamas/Mike Sergeant)\t6:00\n3. &quot;Fuga para o EspaÃƒÂ§o&quot; (JosÃƒÂ© Cid)\t        8:10\n4. &quot;Mellotron, o Planeta FantÃƒÂ¡stico&quot; (JosÃƒÂ© Cid)\t6:43\n5. &quot;10000 Anos Depois Entre VÃƒÂ©nus e Marte&quot; (JosÃƒÂ© Cid/ZÃƒÂ© Nabo)\t6:05\n6. &quot;A Partir do Zero&quot; (Ramon Galarza/JosÃƒÂ© Cid)\t4:43\n7. &quot;Memos&quot; (JosÃƒÂ© Cid)\t\t\n\nFLAC version here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8395360/10_000_Anos_Depois_Entre_Venus_E_Marte\n\nBoth from CD, vinil copy from the original on the way soon...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1ef0688cf19bd727daf7dc20fb00785a243f32d","amp;dn":"10%2C000+Years+Later+Between+Venus+and+Mars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1ef0688cf19bd727daf7dc20fb00785a243f32d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,239,6,136,207,25,189,114,125,175,125,194,15,176,7,133,162,67,243,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

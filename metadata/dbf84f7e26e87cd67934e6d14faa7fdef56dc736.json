But making a film in postwar Kurdistan is a nightmarish experience, the most difficult task being to find a lead actress. Problems emerge one after the other, and they are on the verge of giving up when a young lady, Sinor, arrives at the audition. She is young, beautiful and above all passionate about the project. Her own childhood is deeply affected by the Al Anfal campaign. The joy of finding the perfect leading lady for the film, alas, is short lived, as Sinor needs the permission of her guardian Uncle Hamid and her cousin Hiwa to be in the film, but honourable families do not send their daughters to act in films. Hussein and Alan are constantly running out of time, money, energy and patience.\r\n\r\nWith great visual and comedic flair, director Shawkat Amin Korki delivers a story laced with autobiographical touches. Through the trials and tribulations of his protagonists, a poignant portrait emerges of contemporary Kurdish society haunted by its past.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x554, 24.000 fps, 1889 Kbps, 01h36m34s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, 6 channel, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, Kurdish audio, optional English subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/bjeuw3b9h/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/931lovw5p/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/h79ptmikt/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/8ayxporyl/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/wdfrkk8lp/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbf84f7e26e87cd67934e6d14faa7fdef56dc736","amp;dn":"Memories+on+Stone+-+Biraninen+li+ser+keviri+%282014+-+Iraq%29+drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbf84f7e26e87cd67934e6d14faa7fdef56dc736","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,248,79,126,38,232,124,214,121,52,230,209,79,170,127,222,245,109,199,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

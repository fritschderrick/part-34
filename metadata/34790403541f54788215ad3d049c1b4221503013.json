Charming, maybe a little run down, but so peaceful. That was the first part of the Magic. Midges painting and my music soared to new heights of creativity. That was another part of the Magic. Our love for each other - well, that became the supreme Magic. But the cottage had an alternative side. The Bad Magic. What happened to us there was horrendous beyond belief. The healings, the crazy sect who wanted our home for themselves, the hideous creatures that crawled from the nether regions, and the bats - oh God, the bats! Even now those terrible things seem impossible to me. Yet they happenedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Beautifully orchestrated crescendo of suspense... Herbert had brought the shivers back to the genre. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34790403541f54788215ad3d049c1b4221503013","amp;dn":"James+Herbert++The+Magic+Cottage++2011+Edition++ebook+%5Bepub+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34790403541f54788215ad3d049c1b4221503013","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,121,4,3,84,31,84,120,130,21,173,61,4,156,27,66,33,80,48,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The song was also recorded in Italian by Bassey as &quot;Una Cascata di Diamanti (Vivo Di Diamanti)&quot;; this version was only issued on 7-inch single in Italy, and is included in a 3-CD box set titled Shirley released in 2012.[2]\n\nProducer Harry Saltzman hated the song and it only made the film due to co-producer Albert Broccoli. One of Saltzman's major objections was to the innuendo in the lyrics.[citation needed] Bassey would later return for a third performance for 1979's Moonraker.\n\nTrack listing[edit]\n\nTracks 13-21 were not released on the original soundtrack.\n1.&quot;Diamonds Are Forever (Main Title)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sung by Shirley Bassey\n2.&quot;Bond Meets Bambi and Thumper&quot;[A]\n3.&quot;Moon Buggy Ride&quot;\n4.&quot;Circus, Circus&quot;\n5.&quot;Death at the Whyte House&quot;\n6.&quot;Diamonds Are Forever (Source Instrumental)&quot;\n7.&quot;Diamonds Are Forever (Bond and Tiffany)&quot;\n8.&quot;Bond Smells a Rat&quot;\n9.&quot;Tiffany Case&quot;\n10.&quot;007 and Counting&quot;\n11.&quot;Q's Trick&quot;\n12.&quot;To Hell with Blofeld&quot;[A][B]\n13.&quot;Gunbarrel and Manhunt&quot;[A]\n14.&quot;Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd/Bond to Holland&quot;[A]\n15.&quot;Peter Franks&quot;\n16.&quot;Airport Source/On the Road&quot;\n17.&quot;Slumber, Inc.&quot;\n18.&quot;The Whyte House&quot;\n19.&quot;Plenty, Then Tiffany&quot;\n20.&quot;Following the Diamonds&quot;\n21.&quot;Additional and Alternate Cues&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22e3b0af88efdeebecf7d4d06254cfc49838d939","amp;dn":"Diamonds+Are+Forever%2C+James+Bond%2C+John+Barrry%2C+1971","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22e3b0af88efdeebecf7d4d06254cfc49838d939","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,227,176,175,136,239,222,235,236,247,212,208,98,84,207,196,152,56,217,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

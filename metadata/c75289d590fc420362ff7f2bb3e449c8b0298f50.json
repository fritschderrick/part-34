He was one of my favorite artists. I thought he had composed more than two albums in his time, but I guess he discovered there is more money to be made producing, arranging and being an instrumentalist.\n\nBooker emerged in the late 1980s as a prominent urban contemporary R&amp;B artist and producer. He began recording music after being signed by his late godfather Barry White to his production company in 1984. Later, he played keyboards with a band called Tease for three years. Booker, known throughout the industry as a keyboard player, is considered by his music peers to be a bass player.\n\n\nChuckii signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records and issued his debut album Chuckii in 1989 in which he played all the instruments and sang all vocals. The album fared well on the strength of hit singles &quot;(Don't U Know) I Love U&quot; and the #1 R&amp;B single &quot;Turned Away.&quot; The follow-up final album Niice 'N Wiild was released in 1992 and yielded another chart-topping R&amp;B hit &quot;Games&quot;. \n\nHope you enjoy these albums/songs...I sure did.

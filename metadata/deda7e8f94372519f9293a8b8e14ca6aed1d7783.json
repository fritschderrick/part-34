Prowling the streets day and night, McDonagh's riddled with internal conflict over his increasing addiction to any drug he can get his hands on, his duty to uphold the law, a misguided relationship with a high-class prostitute (Eva Mendes), and a laundry list of other life stressors. In the background of his continuous downward spiral, McDonagh's been assigned to a case involving the ritualistic killing of five victims caught in a local drug war. Knowing he has little evidence to go on, the boundary-pushing Lieutenant embarks on a precarious manhunt that takes him even further down his cocaine-laden rabbit hole, as he steps head first into the land of compromise and self-indulgence.\n\nCast\nNicolas Cage ...

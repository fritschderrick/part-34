The authors explain the parameters of cardiac safety at all stages of clinical research and drug development, including both the preclinical and pharmacogenomic aspects generally and the clinical methodologies and technical aspects for investigational drugs based on cardiac repolarization, as defined by the duration of the QTc interval. Additional chapters comprehensively review the application of electrocardiography in clinical research, the fundamentals of ECG interpretation in clinical trials, the statistical analysis plans for ECG data obtained in formal clinical trials, and the practical interpretation of the ECG results. Highlights include practical guidance on how to conduct a thorough ECG Trial in New Drug Development, how to use new ECG and web based technology in clinical research, and how to follow the new FDA requirements for ECG submissions. \n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 372 pages\n# Publisher: Humana Press; 1 edition (November 4, 2004)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 158829515X\n# ISBN-13: 978-1588295156","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4034b4e298d441cf898fdf3213c4bef176451a23","amp;dn":"Cardiac+Safety+of+Noncardiac+Drugs%5BBBS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4034b4e298d441cf898fdf3213c4bef176451a23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,52,180,226,152,212,65,207,137,143,223,50,19,196,190,241,118,69,26,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

I\nsaid I'd give a whirl and sure enough the mix turned out to be a big\nimprovement. The Oakland Auditorium Arena later became the Henry J. Kaiser\nConvention Center so this nice FOB sounds great when coupled with a so-so\nSBD which needed much digi snit removal (thanks Chris Ladner) which I used\nfor set 1 - the second set I used was the Clugston source but there is\nnothing in the db, so it is unclear if Scott remastered the problematic\nBruce Fried source or got it somewhere else.  Bill K's 1st gen FOB from\nSteve Aldeman that he duped 23 years ago serves as an excellent AUD source.\n\nThe first set is on fire with Garcia constantly trying to slow things\ndown in his song selection (Birdsong as the 3rd tune?!! and TLEO is quite\nspirited) but he finally gives and cranks out a ripping Brown-Eyed so Weir \ncan stretch out on a monster Let It Grow. Second set opening with Scarlet &gt; \nFire is big and groovy, and the Playin' that follows has Jerry referencing \nthe Woody Woodpecker theme (4:57).  The whole show is played well, no big \nsurprises, just good ole Grateful Dead.\n\nOn the FOH side of things Healy seemed to be playing with a short delay\neffect (15ms or so) for most of the first set on both Garcia's guitar\nand all the vocals.  It is very noticeable in spots, especially on Garcia's\nsolo in Bertha and the vocals in BIODTL.  The result is a flange effect\nwhich some might misconstrue as bad synching, but let it be known this is\nhow it sounded in both sources and is not the result of the matrix.\n\nThanks to Steve Aldeman for recording the AUD, and to Bill Koucky and\nChris Ladner for transfering, encoding and remastering both SBDs and the\nAUD source. Thanks to Scott Clugston for the mystery SBD II source, and\nto Dr. Bruce Fried for the SBD I source.\nSpecial thanks to Bill Koucky for motivating me to matrix this wonderful\nyet obscure show (even the LlaMA doesn't have anything for this date).\n\nEnjoy!\nChappy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0c4f6177a0703cd839db1790917daa5af80b3b6","amp;dn":"1982-12-27+-+Oakland+Auditorium+Arena+iin+Oakland%2C+CA+++MATRIX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0c4f6177a0703cd839db1790917daa5af80b3b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,196,246,23,122,7,3,205,131,157,177,121,9,23,218,165,175,128,179,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

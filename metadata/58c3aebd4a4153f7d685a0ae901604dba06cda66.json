Instead of just dirfixing\n\tand add on to the confusion of the mythmess we just release\n\tthe same content with the proper name and grp.req the old one.\n\tBut if you already leeched the old there is no use downloading\n\tit again unless you want to archive it.\n\t\n\tINFO:\n\t\n\tMINDTHEGAP is living up to its groupname. We do mind all\n\tthe gaps in archives out there. If we see a rerun airing\n\tof unreleased eps from series we try to get it. If the\n\tshow is really old and the hope of finding the original\n\trelease is gone, we try to fix that too with iNTERNALs. \n\t\n\tThis of course makes our releases a bit random and some\n\tmight think we are mad but there will be a reason behind\n\tthe madness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58c3aebd4a4153f7d685a0ae901604dba06cda66","amp;dn":"MythBusters.S05E06.More.Myths.Reopened.READNFO.720p.HDTV.x264-Mi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58c3aebd4a4153f7d685a0ae901604dba06cda66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,195,174,189,74,65,83,247,214,133,160,174,144,22,4,219,160,108,218,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

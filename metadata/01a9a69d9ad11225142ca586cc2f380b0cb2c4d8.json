It was released on November 6th via Columbia Records.\r\nHe returns after the Grammy nominated debut single â€œFadedâ€ which managed a respectable #3 position in the UK Chart but did top the UK Dance Chart.\r\nâ€œFadedâ€ released in March 2014 and was the lead single to be taken from his debut extended play â€œThe Nightdayâ€œ, which released on digital retailers on 20 April 2014 via Mind of a Genius.\r\nThe new project is set to feature electronic heavyweights Skrillex, DJ Snake and A-Trak alongside rappers and other talented musicians! The idea behind it is to bridge the gap between his last EP and his forthcoming full-length studio album â€œGeneration Whyâ€ â€“ due to release later this year!\r\n\r\n1. Automatic (feat.

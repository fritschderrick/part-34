The potential consequences are incalculable and journalist Julie takes up the battle through a debate with those responsible. But Rasmus, a geophycisist who has just returned from the Arctic, feels a need to resort to extreme methods. Equipped with a gun, he not only takes the government hostage, but the whole of Copenhagen as well. His demand is that the drilling must stop or he will start killing people.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2381989/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2381989/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Crime | Drama | Thriller\niMDB Rating: 5,1/10 from 74 users\nDirector: Annette K.

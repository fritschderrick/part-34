Her debut novel, Restoring Harmony, was long listed for the American Library AssociationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Best New Young Adult Fiction 2010, and chosen as the Feature Title for CincinnatiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Teen on the Same Page Festival 2012. Her latest release, The Right &amp; the Real also made ALAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Best YA Fiction list (2012). She enjoys teaching writing workshops to writers of all ages.\n\nGenre: Young Adult | Teen Fiction | Dystopia\n\n\nRestoring Harmony:\n\nThe year is 2041. Sixteen-year-old Molly McClure has lived a relatively quiet life on an isolated farming island in Canada, but when her family fears the worst may have happened to her grandparents in the US, Molly must brave the dangerous, chaotic world left after global economic collapse. One of massive oil shortages, rampant crime, and abandoned cities. \n\nMolly is relieved to find her grandparents alive in their Portland suburb, but they are financially ruined and practically starving. What should have been a quick trip turns into a full-fledged rescue mission. And when Molly witnesses something the local crime bosses wish she hadn't, Molly's only way home may be to beat them at their own game. Luckily, there's a handsome stranger who's willing to help.\n\nThe Right and the Real:\n\nJamie should have known something was off about the church of the Right &amp; the Real from the start, especially when the Teacher claimed he wasn't just an ordinary spiritual leader but Jesus Christ himself. But she was too taken by Josh, the eldest son of one of the church's disciples, and his all-American good looks. Josh was the most popular boy at school, too, and the first boy outside the drama geeks to give Jamie a second look. \n\nBut getting her dad involved in a cult was not part of the plan when she started dating Josh. Neither was her dad's marriage to the fanatic Mira or getting kicked out or seeing Josh in secret because the church has deemed her persona non grata. Jamie's life has completely fallen apart. Finding her way back won't be easy, but when her dad gets himself in serious trouble, will Jamie be ready to rescue him, and maybe even forgive him?\n\n&quot;This is a story about homelessness and, of course, romance... The best character by far is the hulking LaVon, the brusque ex-felon who keeps the room next to Jamie and becomes her staunchest defender. A not-too-intense look at some very intense situations. Grades 8-11.&quot; --Daniel Kraus, Booklist","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:697c171fd15d587914d9fa31874eef642ab788d8","amp;dn":"Two+Books+by+Jo%26euml%3Blle+Anthony","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"697c171fd15d587914d9fa31874eef642ab788d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,124,23,31,209,93,88,121,20,217,250,49,135,78,239,100,42,183,136,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

This continues in PÃƒÂ¤r Wiksten's lyrics; even the most sugary pop songs here barely mask undercurrents of anger, spite, resignation, and obsession. &quot;Friends&quot; is one of the most vengeful kiss-offs to an ex this side of early Elvis Costello, and the vaguely tropical &quot;Oh Yes (It's a Mess)&quot; bemoans the fact that sleeping with someone you actually like is less fun than the alternatives. The songs are uniformly excellent, with the hyperactive &quot;Damn It I Said&quot; featuring both the album's best chorus and coolest guitar sound and the glorious &quot;Someone Somewhere&quot; the most singable melody. The nearly nine-minute closer, &quot;That's All,&quot; might tax some listeners' patience, but the hypnotic coda doesn't actually overstay its welcome.

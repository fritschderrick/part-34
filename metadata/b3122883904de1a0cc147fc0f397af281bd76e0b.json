This witty, wry, and unique new book rectifies that wrong. Part detective story, part history lesson, part exposÃƒÂ©, The Book of Lost Books is the first guide to literatureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what-ifs and never-weres.\nIn compulsively readable fashion, Stuart Kelly reveals details about tantalizing vanished works by the famous, the acclaimed, and the influential, from the time of cave drawings to the late twentieth century. Here are the true stories behind stories, poems, and plays that now exist only in imagination:\nÃ‚Â·AristophanesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Heracles, the Stage Manager was one of the playwrightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s several spoofs that disappeared.\nÃ‚Â·LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Labours Won may have been a sequel to ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Labours LostÃ¢â‚¬â€œor was it just an alternative title for The Taming of the Shrew?\nÃ‚Â·Jane AustenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incomplete novel Sanditon, was a critique of hypochondriacs and cures started when the author was fatally ill.\nÃ‚Â·Nikolai Gogol burned the second half of Dead Souls after a religious conversion convinced him that literature was paganism.\nÃ‚Â·Some of the thousand pages of William BurroughsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original Naked Lunch were stolen and sold on the street by Algerian street boys.\nÃ‚Â·Sylvia PlathÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s widower, Ted Hughes, claimed that the 130 pages of her second novel, perhaps based on their marriage, were lost after her death.\nWhether destroyed (SocratesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ versions of AesopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fables), misplaced (Malcolm LowryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ultramarine was pinched from his publisherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s car), interrupted by the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death (Robert Louis StevensonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Weir of Hermiston), or simply never begun (Vladimir NabokovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Speak, America, a second volume of his memoirs), these missing links create a history of literature for a parallel world. Civilized and satirical, erudite yet accessible, The Book of Lost Books is itself a find.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3122883904de1a0cc147fc0f397af281bd76e0b","amp;dn":"The+Book+of+Lost+Books+-+Stuart+Kelly+%282006+-+Retail+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3122883904de1a0cc147fc0f397af281bd76e0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,18,40,131,144,77,225,160,204,20,127,192,243,151,175,40,27,215,110,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

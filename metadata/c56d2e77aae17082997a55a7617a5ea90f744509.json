Human behavior can be \naffected by such exposure and can give important clues that a person or population is in danger. If we can \nunderstand the mechanisms of these changes, we can develop better ways of testing for toxic chemical exposure \nand, most important, better prevention programs.\nThis volume explores the emerging field of neurobehavioral toxicology and the potential of behavior studies as \na noninvasive and economical means for risk assessment and monitoring. Pioneers in this field explore its \npromise for detecting environmental toxins, protecting us from exposure, and treating those who are exposed.\n\nMer om neurotoxicitet:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity\nhttp://www.medsci.uu.se/occmed/webkurs/vervsystemets_sj.htm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c56d2e77aae17082997a55a7617a5ea90f744509","amp;dn":"Behavioral+Measures+of+Neurotoxicity.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c56d2e77aae17082997a55a7617a5ea90f744509","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,109,46,119,170,225,112,130,153,122,85,167,97,122,94,169,15,116,69,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

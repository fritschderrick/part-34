Intended as a critical discussion of the origins and development of fascist ideology, each chapter deals with a core substantive issue in political theory relevant to the study of fascism and totalitarianism, beginning with an assessment of the current state of debate.\n\nThe emphasis on formal ideology in contemporary Anglo-American historiography has increased our awareness of the complexity and eclectic nature of fascist ideologies which challenge liberalism and social democracy. Yet in too many recent works, a programmatic or essentialist reading of fascist ideology as a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsecular religionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is taken for granted, while researchers remain preoccupied with the search for an elusive Ã¢â‚¬Ëœfascist minimumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\n\nIn this book Woodley emphasizes that many outstanding questions remain, including the structural and ideological links between fascism and capitalism, the social construction of fascist nationalism, and the origins of fascist violence in European colonialism. This volume consolidates the readerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theoretical understanding and provides the interdisciplinary skills necessary to understand the concrete social, economic and political conditions which generate and sustain fascism.\n\nA timely critique of culturalist and revisionist approaches in fascism studies which provides a concise overview of theoretical debates between liberalism, Marxism and poststructuralism, this text will be of great interest to students of politics, modern history and sociology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce84ec68710077b1f41c39e58e20987852415c22","amp;dn":"Fascism+and+Political+Theory%3A+Critical+Perspectives+on+Fascist+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce84ec68710077b1f41c39e58e20987852415c22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,132,236,104,113,0,119,177,244,28,57,229,142,32,152,120,82,65,92,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

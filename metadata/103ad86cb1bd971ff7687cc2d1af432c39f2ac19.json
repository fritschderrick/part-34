Crowned with the Crystal of Destiny, this relic brought good luck to his grandfather until it was stolen by pirates and broken into peaces. Now these peaces rest in different parts of the world. Your mission is to help Kenny find all the peaces and restore the family relic.\n\nUpon the game launch, players will immerse themselves into wonderful underwater locals with exotic ocean flora, corals, and ruins of an ancient city in the background. These vibrant, cartoon-like visuals will accompany you all the way through sixty game levels in three diverse worlds. Along the way, you must collect different coins, gold, diamonds, and artifacts.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:103ad86cb1bd971ff7687cc2d1af432c39f2ac19","amp;dn":"Shark+Attack+Full+Version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"103ad86cb1bd971ff7687cc2d1af432c39f2ac19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,58,216,108,177,189,151,31,247,104,124,194,209,175,67,44,57,242,172,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

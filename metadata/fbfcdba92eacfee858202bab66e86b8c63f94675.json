In this 6-disc series, he carefully examines the most widely held objections and explains how and why they have arisen. Dr. Hahn's powerful presentations will not only show you how to use the Bible to defend the truths of Catholic teaching, but will also give you an invaluable tool for sharing the Faith with others. Covering the Biblical evidence for the authority of the Pope, the doctrine of Purgatory, devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Saints, the Sacrament of Confession, the Real Presence in the Holy Eucharist, and more, the remarkable set is an essential resource for answering the various objections that Protestants makes to the Catholic Faith.\n\nWith ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comprehensive Scriptural analysis, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how Protestants are often misled because they are taught to focus on certain selective readings of Scripture and personal interpretation. As you listen, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see how Dr. Hahn is able to utilize his detailed knowledge of the Bible to show the contextual Scriptural passages that support many of the Catholic doctrines routinely rejected by Protestants. He also shares relevant Church teaching and shows how Catholic dogmas are nothing more or less than the authoritative interpretation of Scripture.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lighthousecatholicmedia.org/store/title/answering-common-objections-6-cd-set&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lighthousecatholicmedia.org/store/title/answering-common-objections-6-cd-set&lt;/a&gt;\n \n \n \nDISC 1: The Pope, Holy Father (01:07:21)\n\t\nThis program deals with one of the most misunderstood and often attacked aspects of the Church: the Pope. Scott shows from Scripture and tradition how the Pope is not an authoritarian overseer but rather a spiritual father appointed by Christ to care for the Family of God on earth. Dr. Hahn shows you how Protestants misunderstand who, and what, the Roman Pontiff is for Catholics. And he offers exciting ways to help Protestant friends and relatives understand the true nature and function of the papal office.\n\nDISC 2: Purgatory, Holy Fire (01:11:07)\n\t\nThis program deals with the Catholic doctrine of purgatory and how it is necessary in understanding the application of Christ's redemptive work in salvation. Using Scripture, Scott explains the Hebrew concept of sheol or the netherworld. He also cites passages such as Sirach 7:33, &quot;Withhold not your kindness, O Lord, from the dead,&quot; to show how the ancient Hebrew had an intimation that the mercy of God extended even to the dead.\n\nDISC 3: Mary, Holy Mother (01:16:25)\n\t\nThere is probably nothing more disturbing to Protestants than the profound devotion which Catholics have for the Blessed Virgin Mary. In this program Scott begins to explain the Marian doctrines by turning to the Bible. He spends a considerable amount of time looking at the Book of Genesis and the Prophet Isaiah to show how the role of Mary in salvation history was foreshadowed in the Old Testament. He then takes these Old Testament insights and shows how the writers of the New Testament see in Mary the Mother of Christ - the new Eve and the new Davidic Queen Mother of humanity.\n\nDISC 4: Mary, Ark of the Covenant (57:54)\n\t\nThis program continues with the examination of Mary and how she is prefigured in the Old Testament. Dr. Scott Hahn reveals incredible insights on the Biblical basis for the Catholic teachings regarding Mary as the Ark of the New Covenant. This presentation will help shatter many misconceptions and clearly demonstrate how Catholic teachings are unmistakably rooted in Sacred Scripture.\n\nDISC 5: Saints, Holy Siblings (01:10:09)\n\t\nTo approach the veneration of the Saints from a Biblical perspective, Scott begins with the Book of Hebrews and the &quot;Old Testament Hall of Fame&quot;. In this program he explains how the Saints are members of God's family in heaven, the &quot;older siblings&quot; of God's sons and daughters on earth. He shows how the Saints constitute a &quot;cloud of witnesses&quot; which hovers over the world giving glory to God and &quot;cheering on&quot; the Christian family on earth.\n\nDISC 6: Eucharist, Holy Meal (01:14:43)\n\t\nIn this program Scott brings to life the Biblical background of the Eucharist as a sacrifice and as the establishment of the New Covenant. Focusing on the Biblical concept of covenant or blood-oath, Scott explains how the Eucharist is the way in which God swears His final and eternal promise to His children. Finally, Scott highlights the specific objections some have with the Catholic Mass and provides listeners with key scriptural passages that will help anyone to understand the true nature of the Eucharist. \n \n \nWhat YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Learn:\n\n--What are the most common non-Catholics objections to\n  Catholicism and how they originated\n\n--How to use the Bible to defend the truth of Catholic teaching\n\n--How to help Protestant friends and family understand the \n  ChurchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true teaching regarding the authority of the Pope\n\n--Why calling priests Ã¢â‚¬Å“FatherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ doesn't go against Scripture\n\n--How the saints make up a Ã¢â‚¬Å“cloud of witnessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which Ã¢â‚¬Å“cheers onÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n  the Christian family on earth\n\n--How Catholics understand the Biblical reality of Our LordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s \n  teaching on the Eucharist\n\n--Where to find the Scriptural evidence that supports many of \n  the Catholic doctrines routinely rejected by Protestants\n\n--Why, and how, Catholics show devotion to the Blessed Virgin \n  Mary and the saints\n\n--And much MoreÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n \n \nLanguage: English\nFiletype: MP3\n \nBTC: 1N3Y2HNWe3xWY4qdYricHRKz58zqqi5MZp","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbfcdba92eacfee858202bab66e86b8c63f94675","amp;dn":"Dr.+Scott+Hahn+-+Answering+Common+Objections+%286+CD+SET%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbfcdba92eacfee858202bab66e86b8c63f94675","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,252,219,169,46,172,254,232,88,32,43,171,102,232,107,140,99,249,70,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

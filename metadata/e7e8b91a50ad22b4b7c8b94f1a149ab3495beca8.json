After Jimmy is dumped by his on-again-off-again girlfriend, Judy, and Fletch is fired from his job as a children's clown, they decide to temporarily escape their woes and go hiking to a remote and, to them, unknown village selected by throwing a dart - while drunk - at an old map.\n\nThe fellowship arrive at their destination, only to find that an ancient curse rests over the village and that every female child, at their eighteenth birthday turns into a lesbian vampire. This is the result of an old legend, where the Vampire Queen, Carmilla, descended on the village, killed its menfolk and seduced its women to her evil.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7e8b91a50ad22b4b7c8b94f1a149ab3495beca8","amp;dn":"Lesbian+Vampire+Killers+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7e8b91a50ad22b4b7c8b94f1a149ab3495beca8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,232,185,26,80,173,34,180,183,200,185,79,26,20,154,179,73,91,236,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

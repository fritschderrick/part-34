As well as the more traditional applications of aeronautics, hydraulics, heat and mass transfer etc., books will be published dealing with topics which are currently in a state of rapid development, such as turbulence, suspensions and multiphase fluids, super and hypersonic flows and numerical modelling techniques. It is a widely held view that it is the interdisciplinary subjects that will receive intense scientific attention, bringing them to the forefront of technological advancement. Fluids have the ability to transport matter and its properties as well as transmit force, therefore fluid mechanics is a subject that is particulary open to cross fertilisation with other sciences and disciplines of engineering. The subject of fluid mechanics will be highly relevant in such domains as chemical, metallurgical, biological and ecological engineering. This series is particularly open to such new multidisciplinary domains. The median level of presentation is the first year graduate student. Some texts are monographs defining the current state of a field; others are accessible to final year undergraduates; but essentially the emphasis is on readability and clarity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d2c8192f1dba9dbe3acdedfe1cbf92e106427ff","amp;dn":"Fluid+Mechanics+and+Its+Applications++%5BUpdated+at+2016.02.11%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d2c8192f1dba9dbe3acdedfe1cbf92e106427ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,44,129,146,241,219,169,219,227,172,222,223,225,203,249,46,16,100,39,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

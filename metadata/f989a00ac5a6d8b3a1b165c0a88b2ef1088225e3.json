With music by James Horner and lyrics by Will Jennings, it was recorded by CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©line Dion. Originally released in 1997 on Dion's album Let's Talk About Love, it went to number 1 all over the world, including the United States, United Kingdom and Australia. My Heart Will Go On was released in Australia and Germany on December 8, 1997, and in the rest of the world in January and February of 1998. It became one of the best-selling singles of all time, and was the world's best selling single of 1998.\n\nThis song might not be compatible with Stand-Alone DivX Players (or TV DVD Players). Reason being the those players don't support MP3 Audio above 256kbps bitrate (atleast this is the case with my DVD player)....\n\nI am not compressing the audio to 256kbps but you can do so, there are plenty of softwares available for that purpose. Just don't do anything with the video, just compress the audio to 256kbps if you want to make it fully compatible with DVD Players....\n\n\n\nEnjoy The Song....\n\nthanx\nvipin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f989a00ac5a6d8b3a1b165c0a88b2ef1088225e3","amp;dn":"Celine+Dion+-+My+Heart+Will+Go+On+%28Dance+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f989a00ac5a6d8b3a1b165c0a88b2ef1088225e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,137,160,10,197,166,216,179,161,177,101,192,168,139,46,241,8,130,37,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Comment.\n\n\n&lt;EDIT&gt;\nBelow is apparently necessary:\n&quot;billy1989 at 2010-03-21 15:13 CET:\nIf you are suffering from black screen freezes while playing on no$gba emulator, particularly at the beginning the game after your character shrinks, follow these simple steps to fix:\n\nPlease note that I have only done this in Heart Gold version, I do not know if it will or won't work in Soul Silver.\n\n1. Open your game in no$gba emulator normally.\n\n2. Click the &quot;Utility&quot; drop-down and select &quot;Cheats&quot; from that menu.\n\n3. Select the &quot;Add New&quot; button in the bottom left corner on the new window that has popped up.\n\n4. Copy and paste the following code into the text area of the cheat window.\n\n020DE16C E1A00000\n020D3FA8 E1A00000\n\n5. Before click okay, be sure that &quot;Action Replay DS&quot; is checked at the bottom of the window, and &quot;RAW&quot; is checkmarked underneath the okay and cancel buttons. Once you are sure of the proper settings, click okay. The name of the code does not matter.\n\n6. Double click the code title in the cheats window to enable it. To make sure it is enabled, look for a check mark next to it.\n\nAs long as this code is activated, you will not have any black screens while starting your game or loading a saved game. You can activate and deactiviate it whenever you want.\n\nPlease note that this code ONLY fixes black screens while starting a game or loading saved games. Your game is still vulnerable to freezes, crashes, the works. My only advice is to save often, and close out of the emulator completely after each save. If you save, and then your emulator crashes before you exit the emulator completely, your data will be lost. \n\nThanks to swayzterbul&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7281e59c1bb1efebc51b49c3ee9095859a80fed","amp;dn":"Pokemon+Heart+Gold+%2B+Soul+Silver+NDS+USA+%7BAypolo%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7281e59c1bb1efebc51b49c3ee9095859a80fed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,40,30,89,193,187,30,254,188,81,180,156,62,233,9,88,89,168,15,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

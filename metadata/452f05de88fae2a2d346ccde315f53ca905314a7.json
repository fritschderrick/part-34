In this\ntreacherous place, where the Baron's Watch spreads a rising tide of fear\nand oppression, his skills are the only things he can trust. Even the most\ncautious citizens and their best- guarded possessions are not safe from\nhis reach.\n\nThere is a rising tide of fear in The City. Hatred saturates every stone and whilst the rich prosper, the less fortunate face misery and repression. Ravaged with sickness and famine, they wait for something to change.\n\nInto this shadowy world steps Garrett, THE master thief in Thief, a reinvention of a franchise that helped define an entire genre of games. This first-person adventure features intelligent design that allows players to take full control, with freedom to choose their path through the game's levels and how they approach and overcome each challenge.\n\nRelease Date: February 25, 2014\nM for Mature: Blood, Nudity, Strong Language, Strong Sexual Content, Use of Drugs, Violence\nGenre: Adventure\nPublisher: Square Enix\nDeveloper: Eidos Studios - Montreal\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:452f05de88fae2a2d346ccde315f53ca905314a7","amp;dn":"Thief.XBOX360-COMPLEX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"452f05de88fae2a2d346ccde315f53ca905314a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,47,5,222,136,250,226,162,211,70,204,222,49,95,83,202,144,83,20,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

ADD !! (Not Replace) six more repaints for the Eaglesoft Cirrus SR22 Turbo only the six repaints (This means six of the deafult sr22 repaints are doubled up and have two versions ; Black leather VC and a Cream Leather VC). \nI made this one myself by stealing the cream leather textures from the sr20 from eaglesoft and placing it into the doubled up SR22 texture files (I also gave them all a new thumbnail to make them more distinquishable against the default Eaglesoft SR22 repaints with Black leather Cockpits).\n\nThese Cream leather textures have just as good detail and make the VC a cleaner and brighter place Compaired to the old black leather textures. ThisAddon  will only change the colour and feel of the interior of the aircraft.\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nWhen placing these files into the directory... you should be asked to merge and replace some files.

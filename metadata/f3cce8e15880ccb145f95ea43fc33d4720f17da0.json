This isn't just of interest to soul completists. Good live mid-'60s soul records, in decent fidelity, are fairly rare items. This is genuinely galvanizing stuff, with a rawer, more party-oriented feel than the classic Stax studio sides of the same era. Especially good are Booker T. &amp; the MGs, who really burn through classics like &quot;Green Onions&quot; and &quot;Soul Twist,&quot; and Rufus Thomas, who clowns his way through a nine-minute version of &quot;Do the Dog.&quot;\n\n01 - Booker T. &amp; The MGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s - Green Onions\n02 - Booker T. &amp; The MGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s - Can't Sit Down\n03 - Booker T. &amp; The MGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s - Summertime\n04 - Booker T. &amp; The MGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s - Soul Twist\n05 - The Mad Lads - Don't Have to Shop Around\n06 - Magnificent Montague - Stage Announcements\n07 - The Astors - Candy\n08 - Magnificent Montague - Stage Announcements\n09 - The Mar-Keys - Last Night\n10 - Magnificent Montague - Stage Announcements\n11 - William Bell - Any Other Way\n12 - William Bell - You Don't Miss Your Water\n13 - Magnificent Montague - Stage Announcements\n14 - Carla Thomas - Every Ounce of Strength I Have\n15 - Booker T. &amp; The MGÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s - Bootleg\n16 - Magnificent Montague - Stage Announcements\n17 - Rufus Thomas - Do the Dog\n18 - Rufus Thomas - Walking the Dog\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3cce8e15880ccb145f95ea43fc33d4720f17da0","amp;dn":"Funky+Broadway%3A+Stax+Revue+Live+at+the+5%2F4+Ballroom+%5B1965%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3cce8e15880ccb145f95ea43fc33d4720f17da0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,204,232,225,88,128,204,177,69,249,94,164,63,195,61,71,32,241,125,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

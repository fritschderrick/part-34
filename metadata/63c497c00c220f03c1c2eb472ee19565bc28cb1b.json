Lovely, lovely people. I share their music because their albums are not available world-wide, it would seem.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.Caritas abundat in omnia (3:27) Hildegard von Bingen [XII]\n02.Cuncti simus concanentes (4:42) Llibre Vermell [XIV]\n03.Si dolce ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'l tormento (3:28) C. Monteverdi [XVI-XVII]\n04.Non e gran cousa (4:59) King Alfonso X cantiga [XIII]\n05.MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡s vale trocar (3:54) Juan del Encina [XV-XVI]\n06.Canarios (3:20) Gaspar Sanz [XVII-XVIII]\n07.NiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±o Dios de Amor herido (4:23) F.

I first fell in love with this album after seeing the absolutely AMAZING trailer for this album which you may find here.\n\nThis is definitely my kind of music, as I fell in love with the Benedictine Abess, Hildegard von Bingen, when I was quite young, much to the chargrin of my Pagan parents. \n\nCertainly, this music will not appeal to everyone. But I do hope that those who have a medieval soul will appreciate the authenticity of these lovely tracks, of James\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' deep voice and Maite\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s amazing soprano.\n\nThis is my first upload, as previously stated, if there are any errors, I am very sorry, and I invite you to message me regarding your questions comments and concerns.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63c497c00c220f03c1c2eb472ee19565bc28cb1b","amp;dn":"Elfenthal+-+An+Ancient+Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63c497c00c220f03c1c2eb472ee19565bc28cb1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,196,151,192,12,34,15,3,193,194,235,71,46,225,149,101,188,40,203,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

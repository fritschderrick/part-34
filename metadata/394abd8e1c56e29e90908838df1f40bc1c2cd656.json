The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:394abd8e1c56e29e90908838df1f40bc1c2cd656","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+3+-+Red+-+8.200+-+Sweden+-+Diskettes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"394abd8e1c56e29e90908838df1f40bc1c2cd656","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,74,189,142,28,86,226,158,144,144,136,56,223,31,64,188,28,44,214,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

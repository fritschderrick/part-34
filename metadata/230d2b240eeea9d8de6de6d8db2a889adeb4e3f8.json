Unfortunately, those ancient shortcuts don't always work to our advantage in our modern lives - when we don't also think slowly and rationally, those hard-wired habits can trip us up. This intriguing book helps us to understand how our minds are predisposed to think about the world - and how to avoid many of life's common mistakes. Among the surprising examples of these mental habits at work in our lives:\nExperienced skiers make fatal mistakes on familiar terrain more often than less experienced ones.\n99.9 percent of the citizens of France are registered organ donors, but only 28 percent of Americans are.\nEarly birds on jury duty are more likely to succumb to racial stereotypes in delivering verdicts when the day gets late.\nPeople who are hungry for lunch will donate less money to charity.\nWray Herbert introduces us to 20 of these shortcuts and biases, explaining how they \naffect us in the real world and how they're being studied in labs around the world.\n\n \nSize 354.43 MB  (87% Compressed)\nOriginal Size 2.54 GB\nLength 8 hours 36 minutes\nChannels 2  (stereo)\nSample Rate 22 KHz{CR}\nSample Size 16 bit\nBit Rate 96 kbps\nEncoder Xing (Guess)\nEncoder Settings Constant Bit Rate 96 kbps\nAudio Quality Low  (Lossy)\nContains ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (UTF16) &amp; ID3v1.0]\nChannel Mapping Left, Right","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:230d2b240eeea9d8de6de6d8db2a889adeb4e3f8","amp;dn":"On+Second+Thought+-++Wray+Herbert+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"230d2b240eeea9d8de6de6d8db2a889adeb4e3f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,13,43,36,14,238,169,216,222,109,230,216,219,42,136,154,222,180,227,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

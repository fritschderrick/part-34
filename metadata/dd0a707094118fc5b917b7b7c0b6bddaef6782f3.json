A person who hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t done serious and consistent strength training will benefit from a Linear Progression (LP). There are different kinds of LPs, but the best will have a given set and rep scheme and will increase the load each workout. An LP will allow one day of rest in between training days and will typically average three training days per week. Some very good LPs include Starting Strength (SS) and the Greyskull LP (from Greyskull Barbell).\n\n\nWhen a trainee can no longer recover after resetting several times, they will need to upgrade their programming to something more complex. The trainee is unable to adapt on a daily (by workout) basis, and must now shift into a weekly adaptation. During this time the trainee needs to specify some kind of goal; the goal will begin to funnel the training. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why I like to recommend that people compete; it continues the funnel into a spout that ends in competition day. In any case, a good next step for a trainee is upgrading their program to the Texas Method (TM).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://70sbig.com/blog/2011/01/the-texas-method-part-1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://70sbig.com/blog/2011/01/the-texas-method-part-1/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd0a707094118fc5b917b7b7c0b6bddaef6782f3","amp;dn":"The+Texas+Method+%26ndash%3B+Part+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd0a707094118fc5b917b7b7c0b6bddaef6782f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,10,112,112,148,17,143,197,185,23,183,183,192,182,189,218,239,103,130,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

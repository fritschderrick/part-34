Heinzer (March 14th 2013)\n\nMaddie Neumann died the day she pulled away from her parents' house determined to make her dreams come true. She wasn't the perfect little princess she'd been raised to be, all she wanted to do was rock. Everything Maddie was tucked away in a box to allow for her re-birth as Rain Maxwell; a badass rocker who answered to no one and lived by her own set of rules.\n\nRain's world is shattered with one phone call from her estranged family. No sooner does she get home than everything she thought she knew about her life starts changing. \n\nColton Bradford knew there was something special about Rain the moment they first met. Unfortunately, she had a hard and fast rule about dating a bandmate so he was stuck in the friends zone. When Rain is going through her own personal hell, will Colton finally be able to make her see how he feels and convince her to take a chance on love?\n\nBlessed Fate (Blessed Tragedy #2) by H.B. Heinzer (June 11th 2013)\n\nColton Bradford never believed in love at first sight. And then, Rain Maxwell walked through his buddy's front door. He knew there was something special underneath the shy, guarded exterior and was determined to find out what it was. \n\nThe problem? Rain had devised her own set of life rules and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Never get involved with a band mateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was right near the top of that list. She allowed Colton into her heart as one of her closest friends, but pushed him away at the mention of anything more. \n\nWhen tragedy strikes Rain's personal life, Colton is determined to be there for her in whatever way she'll allow. Will she finally open up to him and consider taking things to the next level? Will Colton's ways of trying to bury his feelings for Rain in the past ruin the possibility of a future for them?\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e10a328153995ffd3db9800a5a1a426b9ebed8e7","amp;dn":"Blessed+Tragedy+Series+%281-2%29+by+H.B.+Heinzer+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e10a328153995ffd3db9800a5a1a426b9ebed8e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,10,50,129,83,153,95,253,61,185,128,10,90,26,66,107,158,190,216,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The duo consists of keyboardist Mark Moore and vocalist Sonique, whose passionate, brassy wailing is an obvious asset on exuberant numbers like &quot;Twinkle (Step Into My Mind),&quot; &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot; and &quot;Find 'Em, Fool 'Em, Forget 'Em.&quot; \nFor all its high-tech, European-sounding slickness, Intercourse sounds like the result of genuine artistic inspiration, not the product of a musical assembly line or a marketing meeting. \nIn the U.S., the CD didn't do much in the pop or R&amp;B markets, but in dance clubs, S'express was well received.

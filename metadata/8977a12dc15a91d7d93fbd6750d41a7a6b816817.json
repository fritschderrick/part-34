I edited to the best of my ability. If any glitches remain, this is how it was broadcast, not a bad encode.\n\nThe pre-show did not have a proper ending.  It went to commercial and suddenly came back to the main show.\n\nI was certain scene group 2HD would catch this.. but it's been 3 days and nothing has shown up.  So... here you are!\n\n\nFile              : Canadian.Screen.Awards.2013.Pre-Show.HDTV.x264-CLDD.mp4\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 1 240 Kbps\nLength            : 182 MiB for 20mn 32s 130ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 098 Kbps\nAspect            : 720 x 404 (1.782) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 137 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8977a12dc15a91d7d93fbd6750d41a7a6b816817","amp;dn":"Canadian.Screen.Awards.2013.Pre-Show.HDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8977a12dc15a91d7d93fbd6750d41a7a6b816817","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,119,161,45,193,90,145,215,217,63,189,103,80,212,26,122,107,129,104,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

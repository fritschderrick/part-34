Nothing could more accurately depict the adventurous, carefree spirit of singer-songwriter David Ramirez. Uneasy with being in one place for too long, David repeatedly finds himself on the road playing his brand of modern Americana that fans have coined Ã¢â‚¬Å“Folk-brewed PopÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nHeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been writing and performing for over 10 years. From his teen years swapping songs with friends in Houston to the struggles of making a name for himself in Nashville, DavidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songwriting journey has spanned multiple EPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and a full-length, American Soil which garnered over 1,200 downloads in a 48-hr. period on Noisetrade. In 2010, David played 150 shows on numerous, independently booked tours. Feeling truly at home on the road, he calls his second home Austin, Texas. \n\nDavid Ramirez knows no luxury. He wants no satisfaction. All he needs is an acoustic guitar and the words in his mouth to tell the true stories of a wandering man. But to see him live, with only that acoustic guitar in hand, spitting those words into rings of fire, is to experience something real...something that cannot be reproduced.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3aa5015c382487acecad7a041cb0c00934fc19e","amp;dn":"David+Ramirez+-+American+Soil+%5B2009%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3aa5015c382487acecad7a041cb0c00934fc19e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,170,80,21,195,130,72,122,206,202,215,160,65,203,12,0,147,79,193,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

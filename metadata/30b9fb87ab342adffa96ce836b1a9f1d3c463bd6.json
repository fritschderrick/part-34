From the moment Anne Merchant arrives at Cania Christy, a boarding school for the world's wealthiest teens, the hushed truths of this strange, unfamiliar land begin calling to her--sometimes as lulling drumbeats in the night, sometimes as piercing shrieks.\n\nOne by one, unanswered questions rise. No one will tell her why a line is painted across the island or why she is forbidden to cross it. Her every move--even her performance at the school dance--is graded as part of a competition to become valedictorian, a title that brings rewards no one will talk about. And Anne discovers that the parents of her peers surrender million-dollar possessions to enroll their kids in Cania Christy, leaving her to wonder what her lowly funeral director father could have paid to get her in? and why.\n\nAs a beautiful senior struggles to help Anne make sense of this cloak-and-dagger world without breaking the rules that bind him, she must summon the courage to face the impossible truth--and change it--before she and everyone she loves is destroyed by it.\n\nAuthor:\n\nJoanna Wiebe is the author of The Unseemly Education of Anne Merchant (2014). She is also the cofounder of Copy Hackers and Page 99 Test. She lives on Vancouver Island with her husband.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30b9fb87ab342adffa96ce836b1a9f1d3c463bd6","amp;dn":"The+Unseemly...+%28The+V+Trilogy+%231%29+%282014%29+Joanna+Wiebe+%28multi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30b9fb87ab342adffa96ce836b1a9f1d3c463bd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,185,251,135,171,52,42,223,250,150,206,131,107,26,159,29,60,70,59,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Just go! Shoot to kill! And let the battlefields have nowhere to set foot on the dead alien. There are no shelters, no health regeneration, no tricks - just you and the crowd of enemies. No! Crowds of enemies! \n&quot; Many monsters healthy and different. headless kamikazes, big-eyed gnaary and a clutch to larger and more grotesque creatures of evil alien - with such a variety of opponents Sam will not be bored. All the more so that they can not wait to meet a desperate character. \n&quot; eternal beauty. XXII century Egypt - an ideal base for waging war with the aliens. Sun, warm sand, palm trees, ancient temples and pyramids - what could be better? \n&quot; all-consuming frenzy. You want to be a lone hero? Come storyline campaign itself.

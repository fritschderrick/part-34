T. Hefter, R. P. T. Tomkins (Wiley, 2003).djvu\r\n\r\nThe most useful experimental methods for all types of solubility measurements\r\n\r\nThe importance of solubility phenomena has been long recognized throughout science. For example, in medicine, the solubility of gases in liquids forms the basis of life itself; in the environment, solubility phenomena influence the weathering of rocks, the creation of soils, the composition of natural water bodies and the behaviour and fate of many chemicals. However, until now, no systematic critical presentation of the methods for obtaining solubilities has been given.\r\n\r\nDivided into five sections the author has concentrated on the fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic background necessary for a full understanding of solubility phenomena. The major types of solubility determinations according to the physical state of the solute: gases, liquids and solids; whilst the final section deals with those technologically important areas whose traditions are sufficiently different to justify their separate presentation.\r\n\r\n     Each chapter aims to be comprehensive but not encyclopaedic, with coverage of the reliable methods in the particular area;\r\n    Illustrations have been included to enable the novice investigator quickly develop apparatus of their own\r\n    Where appropriate, contributors have included sets of data to enable workers to properly assess the quality of their apparatus, technique and data","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bfa160599141ababe5051dfccf7a90dee74f17d","amp;dn":"The+Experimental+Determination+of+Solubilities","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bfa160599141ababe5051dfccf7a90dee74f17d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,250,22,5,153,20,26,186,190,80,81,223,204,247,169,13,238,116,241,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

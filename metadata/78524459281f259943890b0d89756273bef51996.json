Leary discusses his philosophy, drugs, prison rights, and his life on the run as well as his life in prison. (Prison footage from the 1970's; check out around 17:20 and 22:00)\n\nTimothy Francis Leary (October 22, 1920 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ May 31, 1996) was a highly influential American psychologist and writer, known in particular for advocating the therapeutic benefits of psychedelic drugs. A hugely controversial figure during the 1960s and 1970s, he defended the use of the drug LSD for its therapeutic, emotional and spiritual benefits, and believed it showed incredible potential in the field of psychiatry. Leary also popularized the phrase &quot;Turn on, tune in, drop out&quot;. Both proved to be hugely influential on the 1960s counterculture. Largely due to his influence in this field, he was attacked by conservative figures in the United States, and described as &quot;the most dangerous man in America&quot; by President Richard Nixon.\n\ndata: .mp4, H.264, 720 x 480 (643 x 480), Millions, AAC, Stereo (L R), 48.000 kHz, 1991.30 kbits/s, 26:47.82\n\nbonus file: Timothy Leary - Interview 197x _092.mp4\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78524459281f259943890b0d89756273bef51996","amp;dn":"At+Folsom+Prison+with+Timothy+Leary+%281973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78524459281f259943890b0d89756273bef51996","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,82,68,89,40,31,37,153,67,137,11,13,137,117,98,115,190,245,25,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

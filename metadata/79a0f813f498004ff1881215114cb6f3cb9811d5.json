Due to the Red Scare and her left-leaning political views, Horne found herself blacklisted and unable to get work in Hollywood.\n\nReturning to her roots as a nightclub performer, Horne took part in the March on Washington in August 1963, and continued to work as a performer, both in nightclubs and on television, while releasing well-received record albums. She announced her retirement in March 1980, but the next year starred in a one-woman show, Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music, which ran for more than three hundred performances on Broadway and earned her numerous awards and accolades. She continued recording and performing sporadically into the 1990s, disappearing from the public eye in 2000.\n\n01 - I Wish I Was Back in My Baby's Arms\n02 - I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good\n03 - Honeysuckle Rose\n04 - Old Devil Moon\n05 - Night and Day\n06 - Take Me\n07 - Cuckoo in the Clock\n08 - 'Deed I Do\n09 - The Lady is a Tramp\n10 - From This Moment On\n11 - Why Was I Born\n12 - Moanin' Low\n13 - Ill Wind\n14 - Poppa Don't Preach to Me\n15 - My Blue Heaven\n16 - Meditation\n17 - Love Me or Leave Me\n18 - Diga Diga Do\n19 - Haunted Town\n20 - I Want a Little Doggie","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79a0f813f498004ff1881215114cb6f3cb9811d5","amp;dn":"Lena+Horne+-+Anthology+-+Deluxe+Edition+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79a0f813f498004ff1881215114cb6f3cb9811d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,160,248,19,244,152,0,79,241,136,18,21,17,76,182,243,203,152,17,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

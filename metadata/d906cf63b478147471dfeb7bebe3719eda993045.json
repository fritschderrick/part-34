Is there any common denominator between an ultra-Orthodox rabbi of an Israeli North African community and a Berkeley academic of the Movement for a Secular and Humanistic Judaism? Do Jews the world over convergre and emphasize their unity or do they share contrasting concepts of collective identity? Part I of this book presents a systematic discussion of Jewish identities in this era of (post)modernity. The opportunity is offered by a set of invaluable texts, which appear in Part II. These texts about Jewish identity were invited, in 1958, by Ben-Gurion from 50 intellectuals - rabbis, writers, scientists and lawyers -, from the Diaspora and Israel, representative of the principal streams of contemporary Jewish thought.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d906cf63b478147471dfeb7bebe3719eda993045","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2002%5D+Jewish+Identities+Fifty+Intellectuals+Answer+Ben+Gu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d906cf63b478147471dfeb7bebe3719eda993045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,6,207,99,180,120,20,116,113,223,235,123,235,227,113,158,218,153,48,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

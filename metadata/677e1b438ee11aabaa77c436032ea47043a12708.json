It goes without saying that  He is not always that successful in what he tries to do and at times his ability to get answers from people is limited however mostly he does produce interesting discussions. Nothing is a revelation but it does all paint a convincing picture of the country that shows with the restrictive rules and how they are worked with day-to-day. It doesn&amp;#039;t shirk away from some issues that the Iranian government would rather were not public ÃƒÂ¢?? such as the drug problem, child labour and others.\nOmaar does not manage to give the viewer a complete understanding of Iran and its people. However what he does do is provide an insight into the workings of the country that I&amp;#039;ve not seen presented in the normal news.\n\nIMDB info:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt1075380/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt1075380/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:677e1b438ee11aabaa77c436032ea47043a12708","amp;dn":"Rageh+Inside+Iran+-+TV+documentary+-+2007+%2889min%29+AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"677e1b438ee11aabaa77c436032ea47043a12708","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,126,27,67,142,225,26,171,170,119,196,54,3,46,164,112,67,161,39,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

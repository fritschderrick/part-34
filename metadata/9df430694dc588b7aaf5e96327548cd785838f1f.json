A considerable body of knowledge has accumulated over the last thirty years in this area of research. This book summarizes that progress, and details the most recent methodologies that offer practical solutions to this daunting problem. Implementation and application are discussed, and examples are provided using both synthetic and actual experimental data. This essential study of nonlinearities in physiology apprises researchers and students of the latest findings and techniques in the field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9df430694dc588b7aaf5e96327548cd785838f1f","amp;dn":"Nonlinear+Dynamic+Modeling+of+Physiological+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9df430694dc588b7aaf5e96327548cd785838f1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,244,48,105,77,197,136,183,170,245,233,99,39,84,140,215,133,131,143,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

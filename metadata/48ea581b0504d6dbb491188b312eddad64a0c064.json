With the band citing influences such as Broadcast, Silver Apples and Stereolab. Dimly Lit takes a further twist and forms around the clockwork-like churn of analogue synths, drum loops and deep underpinning bass that go to create a psychedelic stimulus and a real sense of escapism.\n\nDimly Lit makes a real statement of intent and marks a coming of age within the duo. With this full length LP echoing the familiar sound of Tame Impala and Stealing Sheep, Neils Children have crated a uniquely modern, contemporary record that echoes vintage sounds and care free vibes that are abundant in todays culture. Tracks like ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¿Warm WaveÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ and ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¿Those You Thought Would, But WhoÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“ feature that warm valve amp bite, whirling synths and hypnotic vocal lines that penetrate the subconscious sending the mind into a humid, dream-like state.\n\nFormed in 2000 in the London suburbs by John Linger (guitarist/singer/song writer) and Brandon Jacobs (Drummer), Neils Children burst onto the music scene in 2003 with their debut single Come Down. The duo soon flung under the media spotlight with top 60 single Always The Same with support coming in from Elle Magazine, The Times and NME. By 2009 the band had two albums, numerous singles and had the privilege of supporting Razorlight, Bloc Party, The Horrors and Klaxons though out their UK and worldwide tours.\n\nAfter a 3 year hiatus the band returned in 2012 to pick up where they left off and 2013 sees Neils Children seek new heights with Dimly Lit. The band will be playing a string of live dates and this year can only be theirs for the taking with their unique modern take on their vintage influences.\n\nTracklising :\n\n1- At A Gentle Pace\n2- Edward the Confessor\n3-Dimly Lit\n4- The Beat of the Boulevard\n5- The Way The Web Was Woven (Instrumental)\n6- Warm Wave\n7- Never Could Be Any Other Way\n8- Telling\n9- Trust You\n10- Those You Thought Would, But Who Never Will Again\n11- WhatÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s Held In My Hands","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48ea581b0504d6dbb491188b312eddad64a0c064","amp;dn":"Neils+Children+-+Dimly+Lit+%282013%29+16bit+WAV%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48ea581b0504d6dbb491188b312eddad64a0c064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,234,88,27,5,4,214,219,180,145,24,139,49,46,221,173,100,160,192,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

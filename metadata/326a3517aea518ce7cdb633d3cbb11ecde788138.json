With homecoming looming, they make a pact and start a secret club they call the DG (Dating Game). They're sworn to secrecy--and to purity--but the club is their way to set each other up on their first dates so they can report back to the DG. Of course, they all make different choices about how to deal with their parents and how to act on their dates, and they discover that they all have totally different experiences. Still, the things they learn about boys and dating will stick with them throughout high school.\nBestselling author and teen favorite Melody Carlson starts off her newest series with a good dose of fun, tackling two topics teen girls love to read about--friends and boys.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:326a3517aea518ce7cdb633d3cbb11ecde788138","amp;dn":"First+Date+%5BThe+Dating+Games%2C+%231%5D+-+Melody+Carlson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"326a3517aea518ce7cdb633d3cbb11ecde788138","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,106,53,23,174,165,24,206,124,219,99,61,60,187,17,236,222,120,129,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

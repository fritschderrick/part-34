He was a largely uncredited predecessor of today's alternative country music genre. Also notorious for his pranks, he was a prodigious songwriter, specializing in sly, hilarious and soulful pieces. Frederick's tightly crafted songs and intricate guitar work were praised by the likes of Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, and Dan Hicks. His songs are being featured in a series of tribute albums, starting with St. Jeffrey's Day: The Songs of Jeffrey Frederick, Volume I (2008). Jeffrey Frederick and the Clamtones (his best-known group) were inducted into the Oregon Music Hall of Fame on October 8, 2011.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e91fc30eba22e6ad6f95260252cfe05f05cc05f4","amp;dn":"Jeffrey+Frederick+-+Spiders+in+the+moonlight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e91fc30eba22e6ad6f95260252cfe05f05cc05f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,31,195,14,186,34,230,173,111,149,38,2,82,207,224,95,5,204,5,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

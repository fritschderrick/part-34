A Wanted Man is a new masterpiece of suspenseÃ¢â‚¬â€from #1 New York Times bestselling author Lee Child.\n \nFour people in a car, hoping to make Chicago by morning. One man driving, eyes on the road. Another man next to him, telling stories that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t add up. A woman in the back, silent and worried. And next to her, a huge man with a broken nose, hitching a ride east to Virginia.\n \nAn hour behind them, a man lies stabbed to death in an old pumping station. He was seen going in with two others, but he never came out. He has been executed, the knife work professional, the killers vanished. Within minutes, the police are notified.  Within hours, the FBI descends, laying claim to the victim without ever saying who he was or why he was there.\n \nAll Reacher wanted was a ride to Virginia. All he did was stick out his thumb. But he soon discovers he has hitched more than a ride. He has tied himself to a massive conspiracy that makes him a threatÃ¢â‚¬â€to both sides at once.\n \nIn Lee ChildÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s white-hot thriller, nothing is what it seems, and nobody is telling the truth. As the tension rises, the twists come fast and furious, keeping readers guessing and gasping until the explosive finale.\n \nPraise for #1 bestselling author Lee Child and his Reacher series\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Child is a superb craftsman of suspense.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Entertainment Weekly\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The truth about Reacher gets better and better.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Janet Maslin, The New York Times\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Implausible, irresistible Reacher remains just about the best butt-kicker in thriller-lit.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Kirkus Reviews\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Like his hero Jack Reacher, Lee Child seems to make no wrong steps.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Associated Press\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Lee Child [is] the current poster-boy of American crime fiction.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Los Angeles Times\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Indisputably the best escape artist in this escapist genre.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Marilyn Stasio, The New York Times\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Jack Reacher is much more like the heir to the Op and Marlowe than Spenser ever was.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Esquire\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22d49f694af68646c67bb861f925733c2ad65727","amp;dn":"A_Wanted_Man_Lee_Child_A_Jack_Reacher_Novel_Mobi_No_DRM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22d49f694af68646c67bb861f925733c2ad65727","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,212,159,105,74,246,134,70,198,123,184,97,249,37,115,60,42,214,87,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

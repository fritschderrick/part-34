China in July 2006. The presentations given at the conference explored how scientific thinking uses models and explanatory reasoning to produce creative changes in theories and concepts. Some addressed the problem of model-based reasoning in technology, and stressed the issue of technological innovation and medical reasoning. The various contributions of the book are written by interdisciplinary researchers who are active in the area of creative reasoning in science and technology: the most recent results and achievements about the topics above are illustrated in detail in the papers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92f3d67a80f128805b0771342e4e02f681259ec6","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2007%5D+Model-Based+Reasoning+in+Science%2C+Technology%2C+and+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92f3d67a80f128805b0771342e4e02f681259ec6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,243,214,122,128,241,40,128,91,7,113,52,46,78,2,246,129,37,158,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The charismatic orator is frozen on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in August 1963. No doubt it was a great and historic presentation, profoundly moving and full of dazzling poetry and inspiring images. But he was to give another very significant speech that is often obscured. That was to come on April 4, 1967 in Riverside Church in New York. There King demonstrated his deep understanding of how the system works. He moved beyond a simple race analysis to include class and foreign policy issues. He forcefully denounced the war in Vietnam. He called the U.S. &quot;the greatest purveyor of violence in the world&quot; and he deplored the &quot;giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism and militarism.&quot; Exactly one year later King was assassinated in Memphis where he had gone in solidarity with striking sanitation workers.\n\n[u]Martin Luther King Jr.[/u]\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr, Nobel Peace Prize winner, is one of the 20th century's most enduring figures. He advocated and practiced civil disobedience and non-violence. He said, &quot;Christ gave us the goals and Mahatma Gandhi the tactics.&quot; He rose to national prominence during the epic Montgomery bus boycott and then went on to spearhead a movement which ended juridical apartheid in the U.S.\n\n-----\n\nType: mp3 file\nSize: 17.7 MB\nDuration: 00:51:48\nBit Rate: 48Kbps \nChannels: 1 (mono)\nAudio sampe rate: 44 kHz\n\nDownload this mp3 file using the attached torrent file or download it directly using this link:\n[url]http://www.archive.org/download/MartinLutherKing-BeyondVietnam-1967/Mlk-BeyondVietnam67-04-04.mp3[/url]\n\nYou can also listen to streaming audio of this speech here:\n[url]http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkatimetobreaksilence.htm[/url]\n\n-----\n\n[b]Resources and links to related material[/b]\n\n1) Transcript of MLK's incredible speech:\n\nBeyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence\nBy Rev.

Like a pre-emptive bolt of truth from the ancestors, SmileyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s PBS special ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMLK: A Call to ConscienceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ begins the anniversary week of Dr. Martin Luther King JrÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s assassination with a focus on the April 4, 1967 speech that marked his definitive break with President Lyndon Johnson and U.S. imperial wars. [b]Any sane and honest person exposed to the magnificent reasoning of Dr. KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBeyond Vietnam: A Time to Break SilenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ address, would forever recoil at comparisons between the martyred champion of peace and human rights and the incumbent imperial warlord and Wall Street Lord Protector, Barack Obama.[/b] Hopefully, Tavis SmileyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s timely intervention with the scheduled airing of the program on Wednesday, March 31, will inoculate viewers from the howling King-Obama nonsense that has polluted the slain leaderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s birth and death days since the onset of the Obama phenomenon.\n...\n[b]We hear Dr. KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s indictment of the United States that has held true for 43 years: that it is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½[/b] In the presence of that voice and those words, who can escape the reality that Barack Obama is today engorged in unfathomable violence like no other human on the face of the Earth? \n...\nIn truth, it is impossible to escape the radical meaning of Dr. KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pro-democracy, anti-war, anti-imperialist, and anti-rule-of-the-rich politics, unless one actively resists understanding KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voluminous writings and speeches. [b]Only through a willful or imposed ignorance can one arrive at the conclusion that Martin Luther King and Barack Obama could in any way be found on the same side of history. The commander-in-chief of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgreatest purveyor of violence in the world todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ cannot be an ally of peace, or of social and economic justice.[/b][/quote]\n\n[url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/opinion/03herbert.html?pagewanted=all]Bob Herbert, New York Times - We Still DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Hear Him[/url]\n\n3) [url=https://onebigtorrent.org/torrents/7857/Howard-Zinn-You-Cant-Be-Neutral-on-a-Moving-Train-2004]Howard Zinn: You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train (2004)[/url]\n\n4) [url=http://www.voltairenet.org/article163443.html]The US and China: One Side is Losing, the Other is Winning by James Petras[/url]\n\n-----\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90d8bef8b5007ed7b3978dda8b536e57438fa32d","amp;dn":"Martin+Luther+King%2C+Jr.+-+Beyond+Vietnam%3A+A+Time+to+Break+Silenc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90d8bef8b5007ed7b3978dda8b536e57438fa32d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,216,190,248,181,0,126,215,179,151,141,218,139,83,110,87,67,143,163,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

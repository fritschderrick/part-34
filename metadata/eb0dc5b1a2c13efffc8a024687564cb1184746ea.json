So I am putting up another torrent with these two and a few after show add-ons from http://www.cbc.ca/video/#/Shows/Love_Lies_Bleeding/\n\nThe main torrent is here: thepiratebay.se/torrent/7179427/Love_lies_bleeding_Elton_John_Alberta_Ballet_CBC\n\n\n\nWhat it's all about:\n\n&quot;This is the CBC broadcasting of the Alberta Ballet's show in tribute to Elton John's songs and career. The video files in high resolution M4V format and the full length video of the show in the MP4 format (low quality) were downloaded from http://www.cbc.ca/loveliesbleeding/\n\n\nThe point of the torrent is that only canadian IP addresses are allowed to view the streaming content on CBC's site, while people outside Canada might want to see this show, it's just gorgeous and adds a bizarre flavor to Elton John's music.&quot;\n\n\n\nMy upload speed is not good but at least it's on 24/7.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb0dc5b1a2c13efffc8a024687564cb1184746ea","amp;dn":"Love+lies+bleeding+Elton+John+Alberta+Ballet+CBC+2+add-ons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb0dc5b1a2c13efffc8a024687564cb1184746ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,13,197,177,162,193,62,255,252,138,2,70,135,86,76,177,24,71,70,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

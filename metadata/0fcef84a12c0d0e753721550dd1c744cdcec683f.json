Only noticing the aged male extras in the crowd scenes gives any hint of the circumstances under which the film was produced.\n\nMarian, who was lead in the notorious Nazi JEW SUSS and a couple of preposterous Douglas Sirk thirties German romances, gives his outstanding performance and Hoppe never repeated the delicacy of her playing in any other film I saw. The same may be said for all the recognisable players.\n\nThe Maupassant story appears to be the one for the Ophuls' MADAM D. reworked considerably and this film out-classes that.\n\nKaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼tner was the great German director of his day, with this anticipating his fifties master works, THE LAST BRIDGE, THE DEVIL'S GENERAL and SKY WITHOUT STARS. Even the first film from his disastrous Hollywood stay is remarkable. Notice MOLLE has the scene he would repeat in later films - the protagonists traveling at the same time but missing one another with fatal results.\n\nThe war and the occupation reduced the scale and impact of Helmut KaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼tner's efforts but this film shows that he was already well on the way to being the leading European film maker of his day. However, in the wake of WW2, critics where not about to hand that crown to a German. \n\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: Romanze in Moll.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,441,654,784 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:34:16\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 688x512 (AR: 1.344)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1837 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.209 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036316/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036316/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: German\nSubtitles: German, English, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Arabic (idx/sub)\n\nMy rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fcef84a12c0d0e753721550dd1c744cdcec683f","amp;dn":"Helmut+Kautner+-+Romanze+in+Moll+%281943%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fcef84a12c0d0e753721550dd1c744cdcec683f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,206,248,74,18,192,208,231,83,114,21,80,221,28,116,76,220,236,104,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

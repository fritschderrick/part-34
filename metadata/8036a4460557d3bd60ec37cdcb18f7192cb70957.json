In March of 2006 drummer M joined the band, first as a session member to help out at rehearsals, and then on a full time basis.\n\nIn July of the same year, PROFANE PRAYER entered the ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£Diagogi KosmiaÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ studios to begin recording the ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£Bloodred FullmoonÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ demo. Consisting of four songs, the demo was mixed and mastered by Manolis Koutsakis, and was self-released on CD and Tape (limited to 150 copies).\n\nIn October 2008 PROFANE PRAYER finished recording their debut full-length album ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£Eye of SinÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥. The nine-track album was recorded, mixed and mastered at the Basement Studios. Drums were engineered by Mark Cross (Firewind), whilst guitars, vocals and bass were engineered by George Bokos (Rotting Christ, Nightfall). ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£Eye of SinÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ was mixed by George Bokos and mastered by Chris Tsoukalas (Basement Studios). Soon after, M and JNK departed from the band, and THC returned to take over the drums once again. The line up was completed by the arrival of Sick Mind (Hordes of Decay) on bass.\n\nIn March of 2009, ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£Under the Black SunÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥, a track from the debut album featured on TerrorizerÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£Fear Candy: UnsignedÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ CD. The same year, the band starts its collaboration with Carpathian ForestÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s Daniel VrangsinnÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s Misantrof Antirecords, that re-released the bandÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s 2006 demo as part of its Music Archives making it available for free download. PROFANE PRAYER also contributed the opening track to the labelÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s annual ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£Holy Fucking AntichristmasÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ compilation.\n\nDecember 2010 the band sign a deal with Orkestral Promenade Productions and the release of its debut album is scheduled for early 2011.\n\nOn the 16th of January 2011, ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£Eye of SinÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ is released through Misantrof Antirecords as a free download and Orkestral Promenade Productions on CD.

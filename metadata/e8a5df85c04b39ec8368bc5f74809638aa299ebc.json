Zweig studies three giants of German literature and thought: Friedrich HoÃ‚Â¨lderlin, Heinrich von Kleist and Friedrich Nietzsche Ã¢â‚¬â€œ powerful minds whose ideas were at odds with the scientific positivism of their age; troubled spirits whose intoxicating passions drove them mad but inspired them to great works.

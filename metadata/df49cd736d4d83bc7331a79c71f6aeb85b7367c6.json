It was recorded on 19 and 20 May 1997 during the tour for The Boatman's Call and eight of these tracks (plus a version of &quot;The Weeping Song&quot;) were originally released as a nine-track bonus disc for The Best of Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds. It features a version of &quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow&quot; with vocals by Blixa Bargeld, which is delivered in a way that is similar to the demo version that can also be found on the B-Sides &amp; Rarities three-disc set. These live recordings display the more mellow sound and performances that the group had been showcasing at that period, and would continue to deliver in the later No More Shall We Part..\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Lime Tree Arbour\n[02] Stranger Than Kindness\n[03] Red Right Hand\n[04] I Let Love In\n[05] Brompton Oratory\n[06] Henry Lee\n[07] The Ship Song\n[08] Where The Wild Roses Grow\n[09] People Ain't No Good\n[10] Do You Love Me\n[11] Far From Me\n[12] The Mercy Seat\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:56m:37s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 134mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................

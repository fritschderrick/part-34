He travels around the country as he explores the United Kingdom's remarkable past, from the perspective of ordinary people. It's wide-ranging, beautifully filmed and a bit sentimental, but also hugely informative and full of good humour. Nobody does this sort of thing better.\n\n\n\n4)  The Great Rising \nMichael Wood's history of Britain reaches the 14th century, when the Black Death killed more than half the population. He examines local records to track the plague across the UK, and investigates how it led to the Peasants' Revolt, an uprising by agricultural workers. The 15th century saw the rise of a new middle class - Michael visits the oldest primary school in Britain - from 1437 - to find out how education played a major role in people's changing fortunes. Along the way, he also crawls down a sewer in Lavenham, Suffolk, for a spot of hands-on history, while letters from a Norfolk village provide a medieval woman's take on love, marriage and men.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img69/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img69/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img100/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img100/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img197/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img197/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img811/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img811/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img88/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img13/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img13/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img222/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img222/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img690/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img690/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img12/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img12/2360/thegreatbritishstoryape.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1562 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Story:_A_People%27s_History_%28TV_series%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Story:_A_People%27s_History_%28TV_series%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c76b73e5e17d57e27f9a2939381e6cd5b03851b7","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Great+British+Story+A+People+History+Season+1+4of8+The+G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c76b73e5e17d57e27f9a2939381e6cd5b03851b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,107,115,229,225,125,87,226,127,154,41,57,56,30,108,213,176,56,81,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

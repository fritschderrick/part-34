Actually, it's probably more correct to say that Bright Eyes are a group of talented and intelligent songwriters, because it's the pedal steel, the clamorous percussion, the orchestral arrangements, the thick background vocals that add to the songs in Cassadaga -- the band's fullest and most developed record to date -- almost as much as the lead singer's own wobbly voice and sharp lyrics. Because the album is, like all of Bright Eyes albums, very much about the words. Its not a depressing or even overly serious album. Rather, its finding what you can, be it a geographic location or a mind state, when and how you can, amid the incomprehensible world around you; its Americana, full of folky acoustic guitars and dobro and dissent and yet, still, a kind of hopeful optimism that can't hide itself completely under the strings, clarinets, and cynical irony.\n\n\nSource: CD\nReleased: 2007\nLabel: Saddle Creek Records\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie\nQuality: FLAC\n\nTracks:\n\n  1.

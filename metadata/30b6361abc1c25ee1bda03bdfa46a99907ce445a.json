This is a rip of a VHS tape featuring 5 music videos as well as various backstage footage.\n\nMost of these videos are already available (thanks 2nafish) except for &quot;I Stand Alone&quot; which I've pulled out into a separate file if that's all you're after.\n\nI've included scans of the front/back covers for complete details.  Enjoy!\n\nTechnical: VHS tape is coded to a single file, DivX compatible, 640x480, about 1.5kbps, with MP3 audio.  The mastering of the tape was somewhat mysterious to me (not NTSC with 3:2 pulldown) so, I de-interlaced it as best as I could but, the resulting product won't win any awards for clarity.  Still, it's watchable.\n\nFile plays fine in mPlayer, DivX Player, Windows Media Player (with DivX codec), etc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30b6361abc1c25ee1bda03bdfa46a99907ce445a","amp;dn":"Jackyl+-+Music+Videos+-+VHS+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30b6361abc1c25ee1bda03bdfa46a99907ce445a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,182,54,26,188,28,37,238,27,218,3,189,250,70,169,153,7,206,68,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

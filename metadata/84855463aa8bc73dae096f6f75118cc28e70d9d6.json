At this time, Benson, still in his mid-20s, was solidifying his reputation as a tremendously fluent and powerful guitar soloist, with plenty of hard bop facility and a genuine taste for R&amp;B riffing and swinging.  The eloquent slow blues of &quot;Low Down and Dirty,&quot; and the wild, weird use of a Varitone octave multiplier on &quot;The Shape of Things to Come,&quot; and the gutsy if occasionally scattered bop licks as a foil for the smoldering Smith (with drummer Donald Bailey) on &quot;The Boss&quot; go a long way toward illustrating Benson's range here. ~ Richard S. Ginell, All Music Guide\n\nThis is a wonderful compilation of some of Benson's best earlier recordings.  All of these tracks were recorded in 1968 and 1969 and includes a wonderful vocal &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; and an excellent Beatles medley, &quot;Something/Octopus's Garden&quot;.  Benson is one of those great artists who is equally at home in the pop field, as well as being a very talented jazz musician.  This is an excellent introductory album for anyone who is not that familiar with Benson.  And it is practically a guarantee that you'll want to hear more of his music after hearing this.  The booklet contains liner notes on the songs and Benson. ~ G.

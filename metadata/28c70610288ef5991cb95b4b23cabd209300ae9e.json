Since I did not create these files myself, I cannot verify whether their are genuinely lossless. All songs sound fantastic, though! Any feedback is eagerly anticipated.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that you already bought this album. Otherwise, go and get it now ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nNME Review:\r\nThat the release of â€˜Ropewalkâ€™ was delayed while frontman Kyle Falconer checked into the Hope Clinic in Thailand â€“ the same rehab facility as Pete Doherty â€“ to kick an addiction to drugs and alcohol, will do little to erase the old 2007 perception of The View as â€˜Liberteensâ€™ - four caners who worshipped the ground that Doherty had passed out on. Itâ€™s a shame, because the Dundonian band have proved themselves willing to chance their arm creatively â€“ no more so than here.\r\n\r\nOn their fifth album, producer Albert Hammond Jr â€“ assisted by his longtime Strokesâ€™ collaborator Gus Oberg â€“ provides kindling for The Viewâ€™s fire. His first job as boss was to rip up the demos Kyle and co brought. Instead tracks were built up in the studio. The result is an album teeming with hooks and melodies butting up against countermelodies, and a crisp, vibrant pop production. â€˜Under The Rugâ€™ â€“ the first ever song penned by guitarist Pete Reilly â€“ starts off with a quintessentially Strokes-y guitar line before bursting into a summery, jubilant Levellers tune, while â€˜Marriageâ€™ is a skeletal quasi-R&amp;B number with a bass that recalls Tigaâ€™s â€˜Sunglasses At Nightâ€™. Hammond Jr saw Kyleâ€™s vocals as The Viewâ€™s secret weapon; and he buries songs in a terrine of layered vocals, such as on â€˜Talk About Twoâ€™ â€“ Brylcreemed doo-wop straight out of John Watersâ€™ Cry Baby.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, â€˜Psychoticâ€™ seemingly deals most explicitly with Kyleâ€™s demons. Over a track that sounds like Simple Minds covering The Cure, he laments about being high, concluding â€œthe stuff you call your saviour is really killing youâ€. Steeped in sleet-skied squalor, â€˜Cracksâ€™ is the closest the album comes to the ramshackle View of yore, and sees bassist Kieren Webster barrel through a punky torrent that recalls early Jamie T in his tar-thick Tayside brogue â€“ youâ€™re more likely to decipher Babymetalâ€™s lyrics.\r\n\r\nThe diversity continues with â€˜Tenement Lightâ€™. Channeling the lip-curling glam strut delivery of Marc Bolan, itâ€™s like T Rex fronting the Ramones â€“ before partway through the periscope of The Beatlesâ€™ 'Yellow Submarine' pops up for a psych diversion. While the barometer of public taste has shifted from the days when working class boys-with-guitars were rife, you have to applaud The View for updating their legacy without resorting to dÃ©jÃ -View or an EDM chart-landgrab","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28c70610288ef5991cb95b4b23cabd209300ae9e","amp;dn":"The+View+-+Ropewalk+%282015%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28c70610288ef5991cb95b4b23cabd209300ae9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,199,6,16,40,142,245,153,28,185,91,75,35,202,189,32,147,0,174,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

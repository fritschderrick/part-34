Please seed and share with our friends here at TPB!\n\nThis is one of the better Marvel series since the turn of the century. Writer Peter David did outstanding work, although honestly I found the hero less interesting than his supporting cast of Rick Jones, his wife Marlo, Phyla-Vell and Moondragon. (David carried over Rick and Marlo from his classic run on Incredible Hulk.)\n\n------\n\nThis torrent contains:\n\nCaptain Marvel 00 (1999) (Wizard magazine giveaway)\nCaptain Marvel 01-35 (2000-2002)\nCaptain Marvel 01-25 (2002-2004)\n\nand the extras:\n\nAvengers Forever 01-12 (1998-2000) (1280px digital releases)\n\n------\n\nFrom Wikipedia, with corrections by me:\n\nGenis-Vell first appeared in Silver Surfer Annual #6 (1993) using the codename &quot;Legacy.&quot; He appeared in various Marvel titles in 1994 and 1995, primarily Silver Surfer and the Cosmic Powers miniseries. He starred in Captain Marvel (vol. 2) by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist Ed Benes in 1995 and 1996. The series was abruptly canceled after only six issues; plots for the unpublished issues #7-12 were later summarized by Nicieza in a fill-in issue (#14) of Captain Marvel (vol. 3) series in 2000.\n\nLegacy made one-issue appearances in Avengers Unplugged and Silver Surfer in 1996, but wouldn't appear for another two years, when he was included in a new Warlock title for four issues. \n\nHis appearances in the Avengers Forever miniseries led to another Captain Marvel series, starting with a free #0 preview issue bagged with Wizard Magazine, in the fall of 1999. Captain Marvel (vol. 3) by writer Peter David and artist ChrisCross would last 35 issues, until 2002.\n\nIn 2002 Marvel launched the U-Decide campaign in an attempt to bolster sales on several comics. Captain Marvel was renumbered to issue number one, and Peter David, its writer, took the book in a new direction. Captain Marvel vol. 4 was canceled with issue #25 in 2004 due to low sales. Peter David was given the chance to resolve the plot in a single issue.\n\nIn 2005, Genis-Vell joined the Thunderbolts in 2005's New Thunderbolts #1 and died in Thunderbolts #100 (2006).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e68ef4b4a365b4020a4ae3f24bfac289a1ea218","amp;dn":"CAPTAIN+MARVEL+%281999-2004%29+61+Issues+COMPLETE+and+More+%28REQUEST%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e68ef4b4a365b4020a4ae3f24bfac289a1ea218","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,104,239,75,74,54,91,64,32,164,174,63,36,191,172,40,154,30,162,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

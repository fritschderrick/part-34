It went top 5 in 1964. The Dictators covered it and so did the Ramones- it was on their Leave Home album. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a true garage classic and a punk rock favorite of mine.\n \nWritten by Henry Glover &amp; Morris Levy\nTim Timebomb Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Vocals, Guitar\nKevin Bivona Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitar, B3 Organ, Background Vocals\nJustin Bivona Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass, Background Vocals\nJesse Bivona Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums, Background Vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6651d617037b9571fc0a9ba1341fafeacaab3586","amp;dn":"California+Sun+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6651d617037b9571fc0a9ba1341fafeacaab3586","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,81,214,23,3,123,149,113,252,10,155,161,52,31,175,234,202,171,53,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

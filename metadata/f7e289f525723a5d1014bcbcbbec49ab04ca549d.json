The song was written by Knowles, Ne-Yo, Tor Erik Hermansen, Mikkel S. Eriksen, Espen Lind, Amund BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸rklund, and produced by Stargate and Knowles for her second solo album, B'Day (2006). Originally not created for Knowles, she re-arranged the demo presented by the producersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a country-turned-contemporary R&amp;B-pop song. The lyrics refer to breaking up with an unfaithful man, part of Knowles and Ne-Yo's vision of creating a record that people could relate to, and was considered an anthem to female empowerment.\n\nFollowing the less successful chart performances of &quot;DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©jÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  Vu&quot; and &quot;Ring the Alarm&quot;, &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; was released on December 5, 2006 in the United States as the album's third single, and the second single in most international music markets. &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; was a worldwide commercial and critical success, becoming Knowles' second best-selling single in her solo career after &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and B'Day's most successful release. The single performed well on the US Billboard Hot 100, remaining at the top spot for ten consecutive weeks. Certified multi-platinum, &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; is the US' best-selling single in 2007.\n\n&quot;Irreplaceable&quot; was lauded by contemporary critics, citing its distinct production compared with most tracks featured on the album. The song won awards, including one during the 2007 Soul Train Music Award. The single's music video, which features the debut performance of Knowles' all-female band Suga Mama, earned Knowles additional awards.\n\n&quot;Irreplaceable&quot; was directed by Anthony Mandler, who co-directed the video of &quot;Get Me Bodied&quot;. The video features the debut performance of Knowles' all-female band, Suga Mama, who also appeared in the &quot;Green Light&quot; music video. Her acting-then-ex-boyfriend in the video is model Bobby Roache, who played police officer for the &quot;Ring the Alarm&quot; music video and warrior during Jay-Z and Knowles' live performance at the 2006 Fashion Rocks show. The video was included on the 2007 B'Day Anthology Video Album, and a video edit was produced for &quot;Irreemplazable&quot;. Part of the video which shows Knowles dancing in silhouette in front of a glass door is inspired by a James Bond movie. Late in January 2008, &quot;Irreemplazable&quot; premiered on the MiTRL, a video countdown show on the bilingual channel MTV Tr3s.\n\nThe music video follows the storyline of the song's lyrics. &quot;She told me to pack up all my stuff, I'm getting kicked out ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the video starts off like that&quot;, said Roache. Mid-way in the video, Knowles follows her then-ex boyfriend outside the house and leans on a 2007 Jaguar XK. She appears to be pretentiously caressing him; only to find out she would be collecting things she bought for him. He leaves her and the car, about to ride off in a taxi. Between cuts, Knowles manages herself in front of a mirror; putting on a lipstick, wearing huge curlers and a high-waisted skirt. Towards the end of the video, she sings with her all-female band. It ends with Knowles greeting her new boyfriend at the front door.\n\nAt the 2007 Black Entertainment Television (BET) Awards, Knowles won Video of the Year Award for &quot;Irreplaceable&quot;, an award &quot;Beautiful Liar&quot; was nominated. It was nominated for Video of the Year during the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards, but was beaten by Rihanna's single &quot;Umbrella&quot;. At the 2007 Soul Train Music Awards, the video was nominated for the Michael Jackson Award for Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap Music Video, but lost to rapper Jay-Z's &quot;Show Me What You Got&quot; video.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7e289f525723a5d1014bcbcbbec49ab04ca549d","amp;dn":"Beyonce+-+Irreplaceable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7e289f525723a5d1014bcbcbbec49ab04ca549d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,226,137,245,37,114,58,93,16,20,188,188,187,236,73,171,4,202,84,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

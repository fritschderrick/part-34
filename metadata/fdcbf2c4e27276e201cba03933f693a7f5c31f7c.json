Set during the Lanna period, a mysterious murder takes place in the woods. But itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not the killing itself that sparks the controversy but the strange trial that ensues where the event is told from the different perspective of three witnesses; a monk, a woodcutter and an undertaker. With contradicting versions of what happened, the classic story explores time-honoured themes like truth and morality amidst difficult circumstances.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdcbf2c4e27276e201cba03933f693a7f5c31f7c","amp;dn":"U+Mong+Pa+Meung+%28The+Outrage%29+DVD+nosub+%5BThai+Movie%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdcbf2c4e27276e201cba03933f693a7f5c31f7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,203,242,196,226,114,118,226,1,203,160,57,51,246,147,167,245,195,31,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

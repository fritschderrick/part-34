The application can perform multiple adjustments so that the items in your photos are restored to their original proportion. The Loupe tool allows you to precisely place anchor points to solve problems with keystoning and tilted horizons.\n\nMake buildings plumb again\nRecreate the original shapes of buildings. Converging vertical and horizontal lines once again become parallel, unnatural-looking facades regain their normal appearance. This feature helps you restore a natural look to your landscape, architectural, and urban photos.\n\nRestore the natural proportions of your subjects\nRestore the natural proportions of the people on the edges of your photos in just one click. DxO ViewPoint automatically corrects stretched-out faces or distorted body shapes that can occur when you shoot with a wide-angle lens (a phenomenon known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“volume anamorphosisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). This exclusive feature from DxO Labs, adapted to your specific equipment, is particularly useful for group or wedding photos.\n\nYour images corrected in just a few clicks\nTrace the lines that you want to correct: the keystoning correction tool lets you fix your photo in seconds! Easily define straight lines so as to reestablish the proper shapes of the most complex forms, and enjoy unparalleled results for your entire photo in just one click. Use the Loupe tool to precisely place your anchor points: slider settings are accurate at all zoom levels to help you achieve the best possible corrections.\n\nChoose the version that best meets your needs\nEnjoy 3-in-1 DxO ViewPoint! You can use DxO ViewPoint as a standalone application AND as a plugin for PhotoShop AND as a plugin for Lightroom at the same time. Directly apply corrections to your photos using the standalone application. Launch the program, open the photos you want to change, and make your corrections in just a few clicks!\n\nPreserve your work environment and your reflexive work habits while enriching your AdobeÃ‚Â® solution. Used as a plugin, DxO ViewPoint integrates seamlessly with AdobeÃ‚Â® PhotoshopÃ‚Â®CS and with AdobeÃ‚Â®PhotoshopÃ‚Â® LightroomÃ‚Â®. Open an image in your compatible host application and apply your your usual settings. Then launch DxO ViewPoint directly from the Filters menu in AdobeÃ‚Â® PhotoshopÃ‚Â® or from Photo in AdobeÃ‚Â® PhotoshopÃ‚Â® LightroomÃ‚Â®. Make your corrections and save your changes, and voila! Ã¢â‚¬â€ your host application now displays your modified image! DxO ViewPoint is optimized for use with AdobeÃ‚Â® PhotoshopÃ‚Â® CS3, CS4 (32 &amp; 64 bits), CS5 (32 &amp; 64 bits), CS6 (32 &amp; 64 bits) and AdobeÃ‚Â® PhotoshopÃ‚Â® LightroomÃ‚Â® 3 and 4.\n\nA level horizon regardless of shooting conditions\nRestore equilibrium and authenticity to your photos by straightening out an unintentionally tilted horizon. The natural visual cues are put back in their proper place and your eyes can once again enjoy an image with a precisely-leveled horizon line. Conversely, you can use this tool to creatively change the orientation of the horizon to produce a dynamic or calming effect, according to your own tastes.\n\nFine-tune the position of your camera\nVirtually shift the angle at which you shot your photo. The shift point of view tool lets you change your shooting angle after the fact so that it is perfectly in line with the image you want to produce. You can reposition your camera vertically as well as horizontally - a real plus for achieving a precise effect.\n\nMaximize the visible field after correction\nKeep the maximum of the visible field in your photos regardless of the corrections you apply. Correct keystoning, straighten the horizon, shift the point of view: the automatic cropping feature systematically optimizes the visible field. A DxO Labs exclusive.\n\nImpeccable, undistorted images from center to edges\nGive harmonious proportions to the subjects in your group or wedding photos taken with a wide-angle lens. Use the Volume Anamorphosis tool to automatically correct the distortions on the edges of your images. All the subjects in your photos will appear properly balanced and well-proportioned.\n\n\nPlatform : Windows XP/Vista/Windows 7/Windows 8/Windows 8.1\nLanguage : Multilanguage\n\n\n================\n[INSTALL NOTES:]\n================\n\n- Install the program in the default directory\n- Run the activator (with admin rights!) + left-clic on the jaguar heads\n- Have a nice day\n\nNOTE: Keygens, patches, Activators, Cracks, Loaders etc. are always scanned with Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 Latest Version to Avoid Virus\n     issues.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d336786e8187701e002b0c0ad947fbb0563d03f","amp;dn":"DxO+ViewPoint+2.1.5+Build+27+%28x64%29+%2B+Patch-MPT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d336786e8187701e002b0c0ad947fbb0563d03f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,51,103,134,232,24,119,1,224,2,176,192,173,148,127,187,5,99,208,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Cebar recorded the album\n following a successful Kickstarter campaign and released \nit this year via Groovesburg Joys Records. Critics have likened \nit to Los Lobos and Tom Waits, though Cebar's sound is not\n an easy one to fit neatly in a package. Rather, it's a \nlive taste of all sorts of music designed to make you move. \n\nPLEASE BUY HIS NEW CD\nRecent Release: Fine Rude Thing\n Release Date: 2014\n Label: Groovesburg Joys\n\nthe sound under the video is of the audio recording recorder sony pcm d50 \n\nvideo FORMAT(NTSC) M2TS\n\nframe width 1920 \n\nframe height 1080\n\ndata rate 16454kbps\n\ntotal bit rate 16710kbps\n\nRESOLUTION: 1080 x 1920\n\nframe 60 sec\n\nSCAN: i\n\n\nDISPLAY ASPECT RATIO: 16.9 \n\naudio\n\nbitrate 256kbps\n\nchannels 2 (stereo)\n\nAudio sample rate 48kHz\n\nDURATION: 00:42:51\n\nfile is 5,00 GB \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ce3c490f6931c10428051f8f8a5442d75f249ab","amp;dn":"Paul+Cebar+Tomorrow+Sound+%28hd+video%29+live+at+World+Cafe+Live+Phi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ce3c490f6931c10428051f8f8a5442d75f249ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,227,196,144,246,147,28,16,66,128,81,248,248,165,68,45,117,242,73,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

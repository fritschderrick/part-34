Featuring a sequence by guest artist Sam Kieth!\n\n\n\nIf you like the books here, please buy them in some form.  If you like what I do here, make sure tosay thanks, leave constructive critisism, and if you want it to continue, please contact your legislators (in the US) to let them know that you oppose SOPA, PIPA and the OPEN Act.  Opposing them is more about maintaining free speech, over file sharing.  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e2cea90f60c5e1aeb4788a7d00d5216c6620dc9","amp;dn":"DC+Universe+52+February+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e2cea90f60c5e1aeb4788a7d00d5216c6620dc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,44,234,144,246,12,94,26,235,71,136,167,208,13,82,22,198,98,13,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

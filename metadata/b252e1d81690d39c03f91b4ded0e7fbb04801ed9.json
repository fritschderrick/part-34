I thought it would be nice to share it with you folks. As many of you know, I don't use any hiss reduction or compression or hard limiting during the remastering process. Everything appears in the purest form possible. EQ has been adjusted accordingly, and mono sources appear here in true mono. I auditioned tons of bootlegs to find the very best sources, although there is a chance that even better sources are out there. If so, I would like to know about it! There isn't a whole lot of info about Stones bootlegs on the net, so I had to collect my ass off and then sort it out from there. Everything here is lossless to my knowledge. MP3 bootlegs and bootlegs of questionable lineage were not used. I will be torrenting all 6 volumes which cover the years 1963-1979. If you're a newbie to Stones bootlegs, then these are the ones to get! - JWB\n\n=======================================\nThe Rolling Stones - Unsurpassed Masters Vol. 2 (1965-67)\n\nOkay, here's the second volume. I'm sure there is stuff here that you've heard before, but here is all the best stuff in one place and remastered with care. Enjoy! - JWB\n\n==================================\n\nThe Rolling Stones - Unsurpassed Masters Vol. 3 (1968-69)\nHere is volume 3. This is pretty common material but it often varies in quality from bootleg to bootleg. Some bootleg labels made poor attempts at remastering this material. I auditioned many sources and used the best, most pure sources I could find. I hope you enjoy the effort! - JWB\n\n======================================\n\nRe: THE ROLLING STONES 1970s UNSURPASSED MASTERS VOL. 4 (JWB's version/C++ksucker Blues) (FLAC) \nI don't have a problem with you guys sharing this set. I encourage it! Please upload the entire series (6 volumes, 7 discs total) if you feel so inclined. I'm really busy torrenting stuff on Zomb and I've also experienced problems uploading stuff here. I wasn't deliberately keeping this from you guys - I was only teasing. I share a computer with 4 other people and I have limited upload time so I need help from other people to pass this stuff along.\n\nIf anybody spots any problems or inferior sources, please let me know. I won't get angry. I tried my best to compile the absolute best material, but info about Stones boots is very limited on the net for some reason, and I basically had to collect and download my ass off and find all the best stuff myself.\n\nI made this series for my uncle who is a Stones fanatic (as well as for myself). I only decided to upload it to Zomb after some requests and encouragement.\n\nThis set was mastered from an audiophile standpoint...only the best-sounding and purest lossless sources were used, and there was no processing done to these tracks - only proper EQ.\n\nAs for the tracks that caused so much controversy - Cocksucker Blues is definitely an upgrade to the other boot - but it won't be an earth-shattering difference to some people. There is a lot less processing but it still sounds like it comes from a worn out acetate. The Clapton &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; is the one that's drastically different. This source is much, much better. I hope you all enjoy it.\n\n======================================\n\nThe Rolling Stones - Unsurpassed Masters Vol. 5 (1972-76)\nHere's Volume 5. As with the other volumes...if anybody has any upgrades, let me know! - JWB\n\n==================================\n\nTHE ROLLING STONES UNSURPASSED MASTERS VOL. 6 (1977-79)\nHere's the final volume. There is a ton of session material from this period and I tried to pick out the best stuff. A few tracks have some hiss, clicks and static. Some bootleg CD's are processed crudely to diminish these problems. The versions appearing here have much less processing. The quality is mostly very good, from handed-down cassettes...but a few tracks are superb. Enjoy! - JWB\n\n==============================\n\nTHE ROLLING STONES UNSURPASSED MASTERS VOL. 7 (Odds &amp; Ends: 1963-70)\nThis volume was basically an excuse for me to remaster the newly surfaced material from &quot;Time Trip 5&quot;, and also to upgrade a few tracks from the earlier volumes. This volume features the newly-surfaced STEREO mix of &quot;Have You Seen Your Mother Baby&quot; which sounds better than the standard mono mix, even in it's bootleg state! There are also STEREO mixes of &quot;The Last Time&quot; and &quot;19th Nervous Breakdown&quot;, which appear in master tape quality and (for some reason) have never been officially released!\n\nJWB \n\n======================================\n(shared on TTD, Zomb, (even tried to share on Dime) in September &amp; October, 2006, except for volume 7, which was shared in August, 2007, and later upped to LL.)\n\n\n\nTHE ROLLING STONES\nUNSURPASSED MASTERS VOL. 1\n(1963-64)\n---------------------------\n01 Mick Talks About Bootlegs \n02 Baby What's Wrong (Outtake 3/11/63)\n03 Diddley Daddy (Outtake 3/11/63)\n04 Bright Lights, Big City (Outtake 3/11/63)\n05 I Want To Be Loved (Alternate Take 3/11/63)\n06 Roadrunner (Outtake 3/11/63)\n07 Come On (BBC Session 9/23/63)\n08 Memphis, Tennessee (BBC Session 9/23/63)\n09 Roll Over Beethoven (BBC Session 9/23/63)\n10 It Should Be You (Outtake 11/63)\n11 Leave Me Alone (Outtake 11/63)\n12 That Girl Belongs To Yesterday (Outtake 11/63)\n13 Not Fade Away (Alternate Take 1/64)\n14 Wake Up In The Morning (Rice Krispies Jingle 2/64)\n15 Andrew's Blues (Outtake w/ Gene Pitney 2/4/64)\n16 Route 66 (Live On The BBC 3/19/64)\n17 Cops And Robbers (Live On The BBC 3/19/64)\n18 You Better Move On (Live On The BBC 3/19/64)\n19 Mona (Live On The BBC 3/19/64)\n20 Hi Heeled Sneakers (Outtake 6/64)\n21 Stewed And Keefed (Outtake 6/64)\n22 Down In The Bottom (Outtake 6/64)\n23 Tell Me Baby (Outtake 6/64)\n24 As Time Goes By (Demo 1964)\n25 Blue Turns To Grey (Alternate Version 7/64)\n26 Around And Around (BBC Session 7/17/64)\n27 If you need Me (BBC Session 7/17/64)\n28 I Can't Be Satisfied (BBC Session 7/17/64)\n29 Crackin' Up (BBC Session 7/17/64)\n30 2120 South Michigan Avenue (BBC Session 10/8/64)\n31 Down The Road Apiece (BBC Session 3/1/65)\n\nAll tracks MONO except 16-23 which are STEREO.\n\nThere was no compression or hiss reduction done during the remastering process.

With a bare minimum of concepts, Microsoft accredits this as an easy programming language for beginners to grasp. The language itself has only 14 keywords, and the environment is beginner-friendly, with a straightforward interface. Small Basic Version 1.0 (12 June 2011) was released with an updated Microsoft MSDN website that included several new Small Basic guides for beginners through a partnership with ComputerScienceForKids.com. The published Small Basic guides include a complete Developer's Reference Guide, a Beginning Small Basic tutorial, and a republished classic programming book by David H. Ahl.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:989b202dc368d795a17bbabb3fe95da394247d26","amp;dn":"Microsoft-SmallBasic-+Magik_420.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"989b202dc368d795a17bbabb3fe95da394247d26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,155,32,45,195,104,215,149,161,123,186,187,63,233,93,163,148,36,125,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

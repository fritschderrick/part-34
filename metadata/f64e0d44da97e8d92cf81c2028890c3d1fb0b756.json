His son Nick is very disappointed with his father who is going to be evicted. Larry accepts the job of night watchman in the Museum of Natural History and takes the place of three old security guards that have just retired in order to raise some money and pay his bills. On his first shift, Larry soon realizes that everything at the museum is not as it seems as the statues begin to come to life after the sun sets. The Museum transforms into complete chaos with the inexperienced Larry in charge as he learns that an old Egyptian stone that came to the Museum in 1950 brings these statues to life until dawn. When Larry brings his son to spend a night with him, the three old guards break into the Museum to try to steal the magical stone. Larry organizes all the historic characters to help him stop the criminals and save the museum.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477347/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477347/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Comedy | Family | Fantasy\niMDB Rating: 6,3/10 from 137 674 users\nDirector: Shawn Levy\nStarring: Ben Stiller, Carla Gugino, Dick Van Dyke\nRelease Title: Night at the Museum 2006 720p BRRip x264-PLAYNOW\nRelease Date: 23.06.2013\nVideoÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..: x264 1200Kbps\nAudioÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..: English AAC 224Kbps\nResolution: 1280Ãƒâ€”688\nSizeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦: 1.08GB\nRuntimeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦: 1h 48mn\nSource Used: Night at the Museum 2006 BluRay 1080p x264 DTS-iLL","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f64e0d44da97e8d92cf81c2028890c3d1fb0b756","amp;dn":"Night+at+the+Museum+2006+720p+BRRip+x264-PLAYNOW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f64e0d44da97e8d92cf81c2028890c3d1fb0b756","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,78,13,68,218,151,232,217,44,248,28,32,40,137,12,61,31,176,183,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

A song like this has to have a gravity and dynamic rather than [be] an instant pop song. Hopefully it's got lasting value.\n\n&quot;It's a total honour. Until you're asked to do it and the possibility is put in front of you, you don't realise what pressure comes with it, and the degree of pride in being asked. But then you've got to deliver.\n\n&quot;YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got to switch off from the pressure and do something that's true to the artist you're working with and to the story. The best Bond songs feel like they're part of the film Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they're part of the narrative.&quot;\n\nToday, October 5, marks the 50th anniversary of the release of Dr. No, and thus the James Bond film franchise, and will be celebrated as Global James Bond Day.\n\n\n\nUncompressed perfect quality","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8797678174a51a730330d47fd4df58117f3276f8","amp;dn":"Adele+-+Skyfall+FULL+VERSION+James+Bond+007+Theme.mp3+Single","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8797678174a51a730330d47fd4df58117f3276f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,151,103,129,116,165,26,115,3,48,212,127,212,223,88,17,127,50,118,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

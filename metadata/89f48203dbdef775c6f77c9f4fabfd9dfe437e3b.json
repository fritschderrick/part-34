The highlight is clearly the sole track with Parlan in which they perform Monk's &quot;Ask Me Now&quot; both effectively and emotionally. The version of &quot;Go Down Moses ( Let My People Go) &quot; is a winner for Shepp's glorious baritone vocals and his saxophone solo. The excellent choice of tunes ( including Duke Ellington's &quot;I Didn't Know About You,&quot; Todd Dameron's &quot;Hot House,&quot; and Bird's &quot;Now the Time&quot; ) presents Shepp in a fine light, where he blows both tenor and alto saxophones. Some of the pieces, such as Shepp's &quot;Party Time,&quot; are less than perfect and the saxophonist's vocals on &quot;The Good Life&quot; are only average, but overall, Shepp and the quartet are a pleasure to hear. ~ Steven Loewy, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nArchie Shepp (Tenor and Alto Saxophone) \nHorace Parlan (Piano) \nWayne Dockery (Double Bass) \nGeorge Brown (Drums) \n\nArchie Shepp Quartet - I Didn't Know About You Tracks:\n01  Go Down Moses (Let My People Go) (Traditional) 11:04 \n02  I Didn't Know About You (Duke Ellington/Bob Russell) 10:15 \n03  Billie's Bossa (Horace Parlan) 5:53 \n04  Hot House (Tadd Dameron) 7:36 \n05  The Good Life (Sacha Distel/Jean Broussolle) 9:49 \n06  Now's the Time (Charlie Parker) 5:34 \n07  Ask Me Now (Thelonious Monk) 4:50 \n08  Party-Time (Archie Shepp) 9:27","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89f48203dbdef775c6f77c9f4fabfd9dfe437e3b","amp;dn":"Archie+Shepp+Quartet+-+I+Didn%5C%27t+Know+About+You+%281","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89f48203dbdef775c6f77c9f4fabfd9dfe437e3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,244,130,3,219,222,247,117,198,247,124,159,79,171,253,157,254,67,126,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

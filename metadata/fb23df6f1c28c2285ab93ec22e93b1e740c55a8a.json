HDClone Professional cloning (S)ATA/USB/SCSI/Firewire media with up to 5.4 GB/min. For data rescue, backup, system restore, mass installations and many more... \n\nHDClone copies the complete contents of hard disks and other IDE/ATA, SATA/eSATA, SCSI, USB, and Firewire media on a physical level. This allows to create even backups or copies of complete operating system installations smoothly. In combination with the special &amp;#039;SafeRescue&amp;#039; mode of HDClone, this technique is also perfect for rescuing data in case of defective hard disks. Furthermore, HDClone works independent of partition layout, file system and operating system (i.e. it works with FAT, FAT32, NTFS, etc.). Thus, it also works with proprietary data formats which could not be accessed otherwise. Besides copying complete drives, it is also possible to apply it to certain partitions only. \n\nPlease use the Free Edition to find out if a certain PC system and its hard disks or other media are supported. It shows all supported and recognized drives, but some of them may only be usable with one of the higher editions. \n\nNEW: Running on Windows XP/Vista/Server now.\nNEW: Automatical upsizing during copying with AutoExpand.\nNEW: AutoExpand + SmartCopy = super fast copying &amp; upsizing.\nNEW: Cloning Dynamic Volumes with HDClone/W.\nNEW: SCSI, SAS, and RAID with HDClone/W.\n\nThe Professional Edition of HDClone is conceived for daily and professional use. Its FastCopy mode and freely selectable sector areas give technicians and professionals maximum speed and flexibility. HDClone Professional Edition supports SCSI hard disks and Firewire (IEEE1394) mass storage (SBP2) as well as SAS and RAID with HDClone/W.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb23df6f1c28c2285ab93ec22e93b1e740c55a8a","amp;dn":"HDClone+Professional+v3.6.2+include+serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb23df6f1c28c2285ab93ec22e93b1e740c55a8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,35,223,111,28,40,194,40,90,185,62,194,46,147,177,231,64,197,90,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

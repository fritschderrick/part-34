There are a couple of ambient moments, but The Starseeds are almost always more dreamy than their Bristol counterparts and preocupied about philosophy and spirituality instead of politics.\nIt is actually quite hard to put it in a category, but the only certain thing is the quality. They have made a follow-up in 2000, and are these days preparing to release a third album, so stay tuned...\n\nTracklisting:\n1. Parallel Life (8:13)\n2. Behind The Sun (5:04)\n3.

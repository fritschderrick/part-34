It studiously eschews mechanical worship, external rites and ceremonies and goes directly to the heart of the problem of the union of human consciousness with the Divine. There is no theoretical discussion in the book. It describes 112 types of Yoga each of which is a precious gem delineating the mystic approach to the Divine. For this purpose, it makes full use of all the aspects of human life-prana, manas, imagination and intuition","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76207010f1996993ea1515a0b8accf4d11969aa0","amp;dn":"Vijnana+Bhairava+Tantra+%28SKT+ENG+only+no+commentary%29+%2871p%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76207010f1996993ea1515a0b8accf4d11969aa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,32,112,16,241,153,105,147,234,21,21,160,184,172,207,77,17,150,154,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Comprising the ex-Samson pair of bassist Merv Goldsworthy and drummer Pete Jupp, the formidable Overland brothers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocalist/guitarist Steve and lead guitarist Chris; both formerly of Wildlife ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ plus the keyboard talents of Philip Manchester, better known as sci-fi nutcase Didge Digital, the band wrote six songs. In December of that same year they secured a recording contract with the CBS/Portrait label.\nThe first public appearance of FM (not to be confused with the Canadian band of the same name) was on ValentineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Day of 1985, attracting rave reviews. The debut album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“IndiscreetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t far behind. A fully-fledged masterpiece, every single track hit the spot, and the mega-ballad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Frozen HeartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ caused lips to quiver and tear ducts to moisten whenever it was played.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fmofficial.com/fmofficial/about.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fmofficial.com/fmofficial/about.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease SEED and enjoy, thanks........!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9f27d984ab50d57f1751fa3c49c3d40ff7bd91d","amp;dn":"FM-albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9f27d984ab50d57f1751fa3c49c3d40ff7bd91d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,242,125,152,74,181,13,87,241,117,31,163,196,156,61,64,255,123,217,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

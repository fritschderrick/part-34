It follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in Uijeongbu, South Korea, during the Korean War.\nThe series premiered on September 17, 1972, and ended February 28, 1983, with the finale becoming the most-watched television episode in U.S. television history with 105.97 million viewers. \n\nMany of the stories in the early seasons are based on real-life tales told by real MASH surgeons who were interviewed by the production team. Like the movie, the series was as much an allegory about the Vietnam War (still in progress when the show began) as it was about the Korean War.[3] It took a number of minor creative liberties with the actual facts of the Korean War.\n\n\nM*A*S*H - S01E03  -Requiem for a Lightweight \n\nTrapper and Hawkeye seek to keep a new nurse from being transferred by Hot Lips, and they vie for her affection. Henry Blake, challenged by another commander to a boxing tournament, makes Trapper fight a big, intimidating soldier in exchange for keeping the nurse at the 4077th. Hawkeye and Ugly John employ the use of a glove soaked with ether to insure Trapper's victory, which impresses the nurse. Margaret and Frank's attempts to unfix the match collapse as they are flattened by the unconscious boxer! \n\n\n\nWayne Rogers  - Captain John Francis Xavier &quot;Trapper&quot; McIntyre \nAlan Alda Captain - Benjamin Franklin &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Pierce \nLarry Linville - Major Franklin Delano Marion Burns \nLoretta Swit - Major Margaret J. &quot;Hot Lips&quot; Houlihan \nMcLean Stevenson - Lt.

The live stuff is some years old which is cool, especially the CD, recorded in 1989. The CD and video cover designs mach the year the recording was done, and the t-shirt is a &quot;local crew&quot; shirt from the same tour. the bonus is a fanclub dog-tag. Not as fancy as the raincoat included some years earlier. This should have been the 1999 fan can but was delayed. \n\n\n\nYou can only get this is this CD and fancan if you are a memeber of the metallica fan club.\n\nVery rare and hard to get now.\n\n\n\nTracks:\nRecorded Live At Reunion Area Dallas,TX 2/5/1989\n1.

NFO .............\n-GCB.S01E01.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION\nAired 04.03.2012\n\n&quot;Pilot&quot;\n\nAmanda Vaughn (Leslie Bibb), once the ultimate \nhigh school &quot;mean girl,&quot; is forced to return \nhome in disgrace after her marriage ends in \nscandal. Reluctant but desperate, Amanda has\nno choice but to turn to her mother, Gigi \n(Annie Potts), for help. Gigi, the \nquintessential proper Dallas socialite, wants \nnothing more than to have Amanda back and to \ngive Amanda's two teenage kids a good southern \nupbringing. The problem is that Amanda is \nnothing like the girl she was 20 years ago and \nis hesitant about re-entering this world of \nopulence, status and salacious rumor mills. \nShe is hopeful for a new start, but soon finds \nit's not that easy to escape your past in this \ntight knit community, and the women of Dallas \nare none too happy to see her back in town. \nCarlene Cockburn (Kristin Chenoweth), once the \nugly duckling, was tortured by Amanda in high \nschool but has made quite the &quot;assisted&quot; \ntransformation since. Now she has a picture-\nperfect, lavish life with a gorgeous husband, \nyet she still can't seem to let go of old \ngrudges. Then there's Cricket Caruth-Reilly \n(Miriam Shor) whose boyfriend Amanda stole and \nlater married. Cricket is now a tough-as-\nnails, successful businesswoman with a perfect \nmarriage - at least so it appears from the \noutside. Sharon Peacham (Jennifer Aspen), the \nfallen beauty queen whose chance at the Miss \nTeen Dallas crown was snatched away by a \nmalicious rumor Amanda started, hasn't really \nbeen the same since. Finally, there's Heather \nCruz (Marisol Nichols), a bit of an outsider \nback in high school who has now become fully \ninducted into this twisted little social \nclique of affluent, sugary, God-fearing, \nsteely women whose bark is as bad as their \nbite. You know what they say about payback, \nAmanda, it's a... \n\n18/Slower+\nEvolve... or die.\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51d9cf94651d1fde57728f8099caee6022358ff3","amp;dn":"GCB.S01E01.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51d9cf94651d1fde57728f8099caee6022358ff3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,217,207,148,101,29,31,222,87,114,143,128,153,202,238,96,34,53,143,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

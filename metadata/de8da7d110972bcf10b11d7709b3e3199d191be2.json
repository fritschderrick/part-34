This bold series, delivered by a passionate host of nature and open spaces, is for both amateur naturalists as outdoor enthusiasts, through apprentice trappers or simple Sunday strollers. The discovery of these huge expanses punctuated by naturalist guides that enrich our experiences of their knowledge of wildlife and flora. Local personalities also add colour to the content with tales and legends told by the light of a wood fire. It sets out to discover a country and men who have left their mark over time. On foot, by kayak, canoe river or mountain biking, the most suitable means are taken to sample the essence of each region and to soak up its charm. The Canadian scale, a hike between land and sea, rivers and forests, mountains and rivers, sometimes playful, sometimes instructive to us, allows us to love Canada a little more.\r\n\r\n6. Prince Edward (IPE)\r\nAt Prince Edward Island, Patrick has the chance to go lobster and oyster fishing and to taste smoked salmon. He also visits the house that inspired the novel, 'Anne of Green Gables' and learns to build sand castles.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 22 (~1250Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 832x468\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: 128Kbps ABR 48KHz\r\nAudio Channels: 2 (French)\r\nRun-Time: 51 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 13\r\nPart Size: 548 MB (average)\r\nSource: PDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged French and English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de8da7d110972bcf10b11d7709b3e3199d191be2","amp;dn":"TV5Monde.Canada.Plus.Grand.Que.Nature.06of13.PDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de8da7d110972bcf10b11d7709b3e3199d191be2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,141,167,209,16,151,43,207,16,177,29,119,9,179,227,25,157,25,27,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

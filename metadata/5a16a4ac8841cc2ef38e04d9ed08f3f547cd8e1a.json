In a spur of the moment decision, Larson decides to take the injured man home with him to a secure building where Calvin can recover behind several locked doors, a fat, spoiled cat, and himself. As he finds himself falling in love, Larson knows his greatest fear is all too possible: that Calvin will latch onto him until he feels safe again and then he'll be out the door.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a16a4ac8841cc2ef38e04d9ed08f3f547cd8e1a","amp;dn":"Feeling+Safe+by+Sonja+Spencer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a16a4ac8841cc2ef38e04d9ed08f3f547cd8e1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,22,164,172,136,65,204,46,243,142,4,217,237,8,243,245,71,205,142,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

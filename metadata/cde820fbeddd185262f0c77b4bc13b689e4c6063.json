In this film, he has a number of gruesome fantasies about his teacher and the neighbor's cat. His father is preoccupied with having gone bankrupt, his mother can't be bothered to pay any attention to him, and his grandmother in the nursing home is asking for some extra sleeping pills so that she can commit suicide. Little wonder then, that he feels a bit isolated. Music gives him an avenue to the outside world; a band which appreciates his saxophone-playing asks him to join it.\nSource: DVD\nInfo: 91min MKV x264 999MiB\nVideo: 25fps 700x456 (DAR 1.67)(PAR 12:11)\nAudio: German aac 48kHz 96kbps\nSubtitles: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cde820fbeddd185262f0c77b4bc13b689e4c6063","amp;dn":"Moritz%2C+lieber+Moritz+%281978%29+MKV+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cde820fbeddd185262f0c77b4bc13b689e4c6063","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,232,32,251,237,221,24,82,98,240,199,123,75,193,59,104,158,76,96,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

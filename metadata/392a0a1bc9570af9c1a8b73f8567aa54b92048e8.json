The 30 minute record offers raw, sinister beats, yet portrays a sense of delicate hope in the sounds. It somehow makes you feel as though youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re part of a videogame and your mission is to travel towards that tiny light at the end of a dark tunnel. Combining drumbeats reminiscent of minimal techno with heavy industrial drones and visionary vibrations, this LP is worth checking out.\n- Dummy Mag\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:392a0a1bc9570af9c1a8b73f8567aa54b92048e8","amp;dn":"IVVVO+-+Occult","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"392a0a1bc9570af9c1a8b73f8567aa54b92048e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,42,10,27,201,87,10,249,193,168,183,63,133,103,170,84,185,32,72,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

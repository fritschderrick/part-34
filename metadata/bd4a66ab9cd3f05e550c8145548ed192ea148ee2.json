The two-CD Magnum Opus is perhaps the most important, widely known and highly respected release in Steve Roach&amp;#039;s vast body of work. it serves as an essential benchmark within the Ambient-Ethno-Atmospheric genre. DREAMTIME RETURN still sounds like a transmission from the near future and the very distant past.\n\nThis 2005 edition has been lovingly remastered using a 24-bit process, and sounds better than ever. It also features never-before seen photos from Steve&amp;#039;s Australian adventure during the making of this recording.\n\n~~~~\n\nPreviews can be found here: http://steveroach.com/Music/discography.php?albumID=331\nThe 2005 Edition has been ripped with EAC in secure mode and compressed to FLAC.

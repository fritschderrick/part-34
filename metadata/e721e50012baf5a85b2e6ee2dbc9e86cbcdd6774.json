The application itself injects a SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) into your system before Windows boots; this is what fools Windows into thinking it's genuine.\n\n\n\n--\nVersion 2.1.4 (06/02/2012)\n* Fixed a bug that would cause some systems to fail to boot\n* Fixed a bug where an unsupported OS would fail to have it's status set to unsupported\n* Added Qbex SLIC and certificate\n* Other minor tweaks and fixes\n\nVirus scanner results\n\nAll virus scanner detection's are a false-positive as long as the MD5 matches. Simply turn off your anti-virus while installing the loader.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e721e50012baf5a85b2e6ee2dbc9e86cbcdd6774","amp;dn":"Windows+Loader+v2.1.4+Final","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e721e50012baf5a85b2e6ee2dbc9e86cbcdd6774","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,33,229,0,18,186,245,168,91,46,110,226,219,201,232,108,188,221,103,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

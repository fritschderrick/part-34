Lovingly programmed (it leads off with her excellent country-pop hit &quot;Someday Soon,&quot; an Ian Tyson classic), this is Collins at her finest. Earlier explorations into folk-pop (&quot;Both Sides Now&quot;), British folk (&quot;Sunny Goodge Street,&quot; &quot;In My Life&quot;), and gospel (&quot;Amazing Grace&quot;) clearly show her eclecticism. Some of the record's finest moments are from her exquisite 1968 album Who Knows Where the Time Goes (such as that album's title track and the aforementioned &quot;Someday Soon&quot;). This anthology brings the &quot;best-of&quot; collection to a new art form","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27fe021ef08720b0885da8085cad30664068be90","amp;dn":"Judy+Collins+-+Colors+Of+The+Day%3A+The+Best+Of+Judy+Collins+%5BFLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27fe021ef08720b0885da8085cad30664068be90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,254,2,30,240,135,32,176,136,93,168,8,92,173,48,102,64,104,190,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

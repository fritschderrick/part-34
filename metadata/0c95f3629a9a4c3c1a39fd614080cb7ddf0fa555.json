The new wave throwbacks first banded together in 1999 in Stockholm, where they recorded much of the debut album Living in America. The record charted at number four the week after its Swedish release in 2002, and an American release followed in May 2003. Dying to Say This to You appeared three years later, featuring a polished blend of anthemic, '80s-inspired rock and sex-craved new wave that widened the band's audience abroad.\n\n  Touring obligations kept The Sounds busy until October 2007, at which time they returned to the studio with a string of producers, including Mark Saunders (who had recently worked with The Sounds' touring mates, Shiny Toy Guns), Fountains of Wayne founder Adam Schlesinger, and former Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha. The Sounds also extricated themselves from their previous record contract, preferring to blaze their own path instead. Recording sessions for the group's third studio effort, Crossing the Rubicon, took place in Sweden, Los Angeles, and New York, and the resulting album was released in June 2009. The band spent the better part of 2009 touring the album, even nabbing a supporting slot with No Doubt. In 2011 The Sounds released their fourth studio effort, Something to Die For, featuring the single &quot;Better Off Dead.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c95f3629a9a4c3c1a39fd614080cb7ddf0fa555","amp;dn":"The+Sounds+-+Discography+%282003-2011%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c95f3629a9a4c3c1a39fd614080cb7ddf0fa555","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,149,243,98,154,154,76,60,26,57,253,97,64,128,203,125,223,15,165,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Directed by Michael Stephenson, the child star of Troll 2, the film was distributed by Magicstone Productions and New Video Group. It was also included in the first 5,000 copies of Scream Factory's Blu-ray double feature of Troll and Troll 2, released on November 17, 2015.\r\n\r\nAfter completing and watching Troll 2, Stephenson became embarrassed by the film. However, thanks to Myspace, he began to realize that the film had gained a cult following and was often listed alongside favorite movies of users on the site. According to Stephenson, the turning point came in April 2006; he stated, &quot;I woke up one morning with a really warm feeling and I was smiling ear to ear. I was next to my wife and I said, 'I am the child star of the worst movie ever made... there's a story here.'&quot;\r\n\r\nPlease check out other releases of documentaries, Rifftrax, MST3K, Battlestar Galactica, DC Comics, Gotham, Star Trek, and more at:\r\n  https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/  \r\n  https://kat.cr/user/bsg4you/uploads/  \r\nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\r\n\r\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d608e9ebb8bdbee6326796823d1c4687f72795f5","amp;dn":"Best+Worst+Movie+2009+720p+6ch+x265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d608e9ebb8bdbee6326796823d1c4687f72795f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,8,233,235,184,189,190,230,50,103,150,130,61,28,70,135,247,39,149,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

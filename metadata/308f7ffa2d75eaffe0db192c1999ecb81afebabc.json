It is thus a term that spans approximately 2,000 years, during which the Roman armed forces underwent numerous permutations in composition, organization, equipment and tactics, while conserving a core of lasting traditions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:308f7ffa2d75eaffe0db192c1999ecb81afebabc","amp;dn":"Ancient+Armies+of+Rome","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"308f7ffa2d75eaffe0db192c1999ecb81afebabc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,143,127,250,45,117,234,255,224,219,25,44,25,153,236,184,26,254,186,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

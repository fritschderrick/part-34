There he was rediscovered by folklorist Mack McCormick, who shifted Hopkins' image to that of an acoustic folk-blues performer, essentially igniting the flame for the rest of Hopkins' career. This four-disc set collects the acoustic sides the bluesman cut in his new incarnation (really just the same old Lightnin' with a slightly different marketing plan) in 1959 and 1960.(AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\nCD A\n01 Penitentiary Blues\n02 Bad Luck And Trouble\n03 Come Go Home With Me\n04 Trouble Stay Way From My Door\n05 See That My Grave Is Kept Clean\n06 Goin' Back To Florida\n07 Reminiscences Of Blind Lemon\n08 Fan It\n09 Tell Me Baby\n10 She's Mine\n11 Til The Gin Gets Here\n12 So Long Baby\n13 Bunion Stew\n14 You Got To Work To Get Your Pay\n15 Go Down Ol' Hannah\n16 Santa Fe Blues\n17 Hear M Black Dog Bark\n18 Long Time\n19 Rainy Day Blues\n20 Worryin' My Mind\n21 Baby!\n22 Long Gone Like A Turkey Through The Corn\n23 See See Rider\n24 Prison Blues Come Down On Me\nCD B\n01 That Mean Old Twister (Backwater Blues)\n02 Gonna Pull A Party\n03 Bluebird Bluebird\n04 Get Off My Toe\n05 Short Haired Woman\n06 Mama And Papa Hopkins\n07 When The Saints Go Marching In\n08 The Foot Race Is On\n09 Bottle Up And Go\n10 That Bambling Life\n11 75 Highway\n12 Trouble In Mind\n13 First Meeting\n14 First Meeting\n15 How Long Have It Been Since You Been Home\n16 Big Black Cadillac Blues\n17 Coffee House Blues\n18 Stool Pigeon Blues\n19 Ball Of Twine\nCD C\n01 Rocky Mountain\n02 Go To Move Your Baby\n03 So Sorry To Leave You\n04 Take A Trip With Me\n05 Last Night Blues\n06 Lightnin's Stroke\n07 Hard To Love A Woman\n08 Conversation Blues\n09 Automoblie Blues\n10 You Better Watch Yourself\n11 Mean Old Frisco\n12 Shinin' Moon\n13 Come Back Baby\n14 Thinkin' Bout An Old Friend\n15 The Walkin' Blues\n16 Back To New Orleans\n17 Katie Mae\nCD D\n01 Down There Baby\n02 Rainy Highway\n03 When My First Wife Quit Me\n04 Walk On\n05 Lightnin's Guitar Boogie\n06 I've Had My Fun If I Don't Get Well No More\n07 Mister Charlie\n08 Mighty Crazy\n09 Wonder Why\n10 Black Cat\n11 The Trouble Blues\n12 Your Own Fault, Baby, To Treat Me The Way You Do\n13 Lightnin's Piano Boogie\n14 Take It Easy\n15 Come Go Home With Me\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc2fc916ae72b7d0642e99c83d8e34cda16ca44a","amp;dn":"Lightnin%27+Hopkins+-+2013+-+The+Acoustic+Years+1959-1960+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc2fc916ae72b7d0642e99c83d8e34cda16ca44a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,47,201,22,174,114,183,208,100,46,153,200,61,142,52,205,161,108,164,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

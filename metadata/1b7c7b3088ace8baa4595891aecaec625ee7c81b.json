Thrown into another dimension by his own wardrobe, Simon starts the heroic mission (of some sort) to find -- another wardrobe that could get him back home. Equipped with his pointy sorcerer&amp;#039;s hat (of some sort), he will also rescue the world (again) from the evil Sordid.\n\nA point-and-click adventure in a style similar to the first Simon game, only technologically improved.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b7c7b3088ace8baa4595891aecaec625ee7c81b","amp;dn":"Simon+the+Sorcerer+2%28PC+Game%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b7c7b3088ace8baa4595891aecaec625ee7c81b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,124,123,48,136,172,232,186,164,89,88,145,174,202,236,98,94,231,200,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

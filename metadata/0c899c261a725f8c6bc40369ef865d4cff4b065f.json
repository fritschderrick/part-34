Chapters 1 through 51 shall be read in seven days ending on the eighth day again with Chapter 51. This method is only a suggestion and Satcharitra can be read at anytime, in any way and under any circumstances. This method is however (as per me) meant to impose discipline on the reader and to enable him/her to start and finish Satcharitra on Thursdays, auspicious day for Baba. Parayana shall be culminated by Harathi to Baba. Divine authors of Satcharitra have organized chapters to maintain a proper flow in the lifetime events of Baba; and hence is the clubbing of some chapters and reading of eight chapters on days 2 and 4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c899c261a725f8c6bc40369ef865d4cff4b065f","amp;dn":"Sri+Sai+Satcharitra+in+Telugu+-+PDF+format","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c899c261a725f8c6bc40369ef865d4cff4b065f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,137,156,38,26,114,95,140,107,196,3,105,239,134,93,76,255,75,6,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

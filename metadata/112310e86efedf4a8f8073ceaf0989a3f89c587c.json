The host provides two or three pots of soup, and the guests bring their own dishes and silverware, and perhaps a salad or some bread. Neighbors get to know each other by name, people of all ages connect and socialize, and the neighborhood becomes friendlier and safer. In Soup Night, Maggie Stuckey offers a practical guide to starting your own soup night group, along with 99 delicious soup recipes and 40 recipes for accompaniments.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/c5/62/fed881b0c8a0f02c7203d110.L._V192416885_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/c5/62/fed881b0c8a0f02c7203d110.L._V192416885_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nMaggie Stuckey is a writer who grows vegetables and cooks up a storm in her Portland, Oregon, home. The author of The Bountiful Container and seven other books on gardening and horticulture, she is happiest when tending her vegetable garden and using the outcome to create new soups. She says, &quot;Even though I now live in a condominium with a patio about the size of a handkerchief, and do all my gardening in containers, I still believe that garden = food. That's probably why most of my gardening books have a cooking component. One of the nicest compliments I ever received was from an Amazon customer who noted in her review of &quot;The Complete Spice book&quot; that &quot;you can tell Maggie Stuckey is both a gardener and a cook.&quot;\n\nCONTENTS\nCover\nTitle Page\nIntroduction: Welcome to Soup Night\n1.

Authority is now more contested and power more diffuse. Hegemony (benign or otherwise) is no longer a choice, not for the United States, for China, or for anyone else.\n\nSteven Weber and Bruce Jentleson are not declinists, but they argue that the United States must take a different stance toward the rest of the world in this, the twenty-first century. Now that we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dominate others, we must rely on strategy, making trade-offs and focusing our efforts. And they do not mean military strategy, such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“the global war on terror.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Rather, we must compete in the global marketplace of ideasÃ¢â‚¬â€with state-directed capitalism, with charismatic authoritarian leaders, with jihadism. In politics, ideas and influence are now critical currency.\n\nAt the core of our efforts must be a new conception of the world order based on mutuality, and of a just society that inspires and embraces people around the world.\n\n\nHardcover: 224 pages\nPublisher: Harvard University Press (September 30, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0674058186\nISBN-13: 978-0674058187\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/End-Arrogance-America-Global-Competition/dp/0674058186/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372561535&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+End+of+Arrogance%3A+America+in+the+Global+Competition+of+Ideas&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/End-Arrogance-America-Global-Competition/dp/0674058186/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372561535&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+End+of+Arrogance%3A+America+in+the+Global+Competition+of+Ideas&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51b66bc0e87c366fd26efc1b8134e608535ac410","amp;dn":"The+End+of+Arrogance%3A+America+in+the+Global+Competition+of+Ideas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51b66bc0e87c366fd26efc1b8134e608535ac410","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,182,107,192,232,124,54,111,210,110,252,27,129,52,230,8,83,90,196,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

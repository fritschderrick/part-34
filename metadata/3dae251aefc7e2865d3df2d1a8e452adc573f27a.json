The creative vision was to develop all of these dark, aggressive styles and define their own signature sound.\n\nM!K!LL began working with Metal guitarist The Omen in the fall of 2005 and released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTHE Dominate E.P.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in the spring of 2006. The Dominate E.P. was a milestone of diversity for their early experimentation of Industrial, EBM, Psychedelic Trance, Metal, and even Synthpop. And though the early stages of their style were born, the hunger for something more defined kept them digging for something deeper.\n\nIn June of 2007 Angels on Acid successfully released their first full length album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEyes Behind The Curtain.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and began distribution with DSBP Records shortly thereafter. Surprisingly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEyes Behind The CurtainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was well received by critics and began selling out of stock reaching orders as far away as Australia and Japan!\n\nDecember 7th 2007 Angels on AcidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s EBM epic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMisery Loves CompanyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was featured on the Alfa Matrix compilation Endzeit Bunkertracks act III along with other great artist like DAWN OF ASHES, NOISUF-X , LEAETHER STRIP, MODULATE, GRENDEL, SUICIDE COMMANDO, AYRIA, X-FUSION, and TERRORFAKT.

With Eagle she manages to rid herself of the tacky production that marred many of her latter releases, only to lose ground to an age-old problem: Parton seems not to be able to weed out her worst work, witness &quot;Dreams Do Come True,&quot; a musical romance novel in which she whispers the gooey line, &quot;Like the morning sun, his love moved across every inch of my body.&quot; Once out of Janet Dailey mode, however, Parton shines on a host of understated songs, including &quot;Rockin' Years,&quot; with Ricky Van. Although it would be years before she made another album equaling the brilliance of her early work, Eagle finds a spark of new promise.\n\n\n1. If You Need Me\n2. Rockin' Years\n3. Country Road\n4.

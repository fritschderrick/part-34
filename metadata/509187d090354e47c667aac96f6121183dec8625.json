BLOODSKINBONES. Blood, skin and bones. Tendons, nerves, muscles and not so much as a gram of excess fat on a skeleton that can be seen and felt. Very much in tune with the Jeppesen brothers bodies, which grace the cover. The railthin brothers, Kim Kix and Atomic Child, are once again a duo after the groups drummer of five years, JC Benz, pulled the plug to focus on his sound studio and family. Benz has however still been on drum duty on BLOODSKINBONES, which was also recorded in his studio. Three men in one room. Drums and two guitars and then a dozen songs that want you no good and go straight for the throat. This is PowerSolo in their natural habitat - just like they are live, where they have earned an incomparable reputation for being a full- on, intense and always entertaining band. \n\n\n\n\nI first saw PowerSolo in the very beginning of this millennium at a rockabilly event in DenmarkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s second city Aarhus. Back then it was just the Railthin Brothers aka Kim ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Bo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAtomic ChildÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Jeppesen on guitar and drums respectively, Bo hurting the drums with biggest sticks I think IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve ever seen, Kim taking the now-trademark redneck attitude to the max, and it wasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ \nWell, more entertaining than good to be honest.\n\nThe reception of their 2001 debut ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Lemon Half MoonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ also reflected this, so I must admit - with the show in mind - that I was a little surprised when a couple of years later news broke that label Crunchy Frog had signed the duo. A surprise turning into sense when they released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ITÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S RACEDAYÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and your pussy is GUT!!!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in 2004, not least because JC Benz aka Jens SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸ndergaard took over on drums, providing stability in the musical anarchy, but also because they had better songs and a sense of direction.\n\nWell, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdirectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in lack of better terms, because it really was all over the place stylistically, the only common traits being their own genre description ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdonkey-punkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and said anarchy which has been the engaging core of PowerSolo since then, even on their mainstream flirt third album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“EggÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ from 2006 (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmainstreamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ being used with caution here - it was as mainstream as can reasonably be expected of these Danes).\n\nPerhaps ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“EggÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t work out as hoped sales-wise, perhaps they just got bored with being nice(r), but fact is that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“BLOODSKINBONESÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ marks a return to the rockabilly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“n punk roots from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s RacedayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, with the Railthin Brothers and JC Benz (although officially out of the band still behind the drums) heavy petting the lowest denominator with daffy humor on 12 tracks clocking in at just 29 minutes and the insanely catchy hate trip on public transportation, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“BussesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, a towering highlight on a really entertaining - and good - rock album.\n\nOthers count sea shanty ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Pirates Of The OblivionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sporting a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHu-Ah!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ psych-polka chorus, the very 1960s rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“CocoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Elvin D Jerk (Part 2)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, the latter telling the tale of drunkard Elvin stumbling on a curb and breaking his neck and both reminding a little of what Arctic Monkeys do. Opening instrumental ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Murder In SFAXÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is evil, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Psych DemonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ pop and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Gimme The DrugzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ a psychedelic quest for drugs in all shapes or forms, while very short, very PowerSoloÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢esque album closer, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Nineteen Ninety-sixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, tell the story of PowerSolo from when it all began in Kim KixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bedroom as a one man act (hence ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSoloÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œeight hundred songs about girls and my dickÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nSays it all, really!

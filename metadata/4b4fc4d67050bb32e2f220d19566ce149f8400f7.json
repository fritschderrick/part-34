In a parched landscape, where seemingly only giant baobabs grow, the villagers are waiting. A growing silence gives way to a distant sound - the food relief truck. Unwilling to live on such paltry handouts, the patriarch Salam travels to the city with his family.\n\nOn the way Issa, the suitor to SalamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s daughter Bintou, joins them. In the city, Salam, broke and in need, decides to sell his donkey and cart, but this temporary respite is soon shattered when his young son Ali is run over by a car and killed. Returning to their district, the family begins a new life near SalamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s old friend Tibo. But it transpires that TiboÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s son Tiga is in lust for Bintou and will attempt anything to gain her ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ even doing away with Issa. Beguilingly, Idrissa Ouedraogo shows much that characterises his later works: the journey as profound metaphor, the landscape as defining feature, and the telling use of silence in the narrative. \n\n\nCast:\n\tMoussa Blogo\t\t\n\tAoua Guiraud\t\t\n\tAssita Ouedraogo\t\t\n\tFatima Ouedraogo\t\t\n\tOmar Ouedraogo\t\t\n\tRasmane Ouedraogo\t\t\n\tSalif Ouedraogo\n\nCredit:\nIdrissa Ouedraogo - Director, Francis Bebey - Composer (Music Score), Jean Monsigny - Cinematographer, Robert Paget - Producer, Idrissa Ouedraogo - Screenwriter\n\nSubtitles:\nEnglish (hardsub)\nJapanese (hardsub)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b4fc4d67050bb32e2f220d19566ce149f8400f7","amp;dn":"Yam+Daabo+aka+Le+Choix+aka+The+Choice+%28Idrissa+Ouedraogo%2C+1986%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b4fc4d67050bb32e2f220d19566ce149f8400f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,79,196,214,112,80,187,50,226,242,32,209,149,102,206,20,159,132,0,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Born Gloria Fajardo in Havana on September 1, 1957, she was raised primarily in Miami, FL, after her father, a bodyguard in the employ of Cuban president Fulgencio Batista, was forced to flee the island following the 1959 coup helmed by Fidel Castro. In the fall of 1975, Fajardo and her cousin Merci Murciano auditioned for the Miami Latin Boys, a local wedding band headed by keyboardist Emilio Estefan. With their addition, the group was rechristened Miami Sound Machine and four years later, Fajardo and Estefan were wed. As Miami Sound Machine began composing their own original material, their fusion of pop, disco, and salsa earned a devoted local following, and in 1979 the group issued their first Spanish-language LP on CBS International. Despite a growing Hispanic fan base, they did not cross over to non-Latin audiences until &quot;Dr. Beat&quot; topped European dance charts in 1984.\nWith 1985&amp;#039;s Primitive Love, Miami Sound Machine recorded their first English-language effort, scoring three Top Ten pop hits in the U.S. alone with the infectious &quot;Conga,&quot; &quot;Bad Boy,&quot; and &quot;Words Get in the Way.&quot; For 1988&amp;#039;s triple-platinum Let It Loose, the group was billed as Gloria Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine, reeling off four Top Ten hits -- &quot;Rhythm Is Gonna Get You,&quot; &quot;Can&amp;#039;t Stay Away from You,&quot; the chart-topping &quot;Anything for You,&quot; and &quot;1-2-3.&quot; 1989&amp;#039;s Cuts Both Ways was credited to Estefan alone and generated her second number one hit, &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Wanna Lose You&quot;; however, while touring in support of the album, on March 20, 1990, her bus was struck by a tractor trailer. She suffered a broken vertebrae that required extensive surgery and kept her off the road for over a year. Emilio Estefan and the couple&amp;#039;s son were injured in the crash as well, but all three recovered. Estefan resurfaced in 1991 with Into the Light, again topping the charts with &quot;Coming Out of the Dark,&quot; a single inspired by her near-fatal accident; two more cuts from the album, &quot;Can&amp;#039;t Forget You&quot; and &quot;Live for Loving You,&quot; secured her foothold on the adult contemporary charts.\nWith 1993&amp;#039;s Mi Tierra, Estefan returned to her roots, recording her first Spanish-language record in close to a decade and earning a Grammy Award for Best Tropical Latin Album; on the follow-up, 1994&amp;#039;s covers collection Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me, she also recalled her dance-pop origins with a rendition of the Vicki Sue Robinson disco classic &quot;Turn the Beat Around.&quot; Another all-Spanish effort, Abriendo Puertas, earned the Grammy as well, while Destiny featured &quot;Reach,&quot; named the official theme of the 1996 Summer Olympics. As Latin pop made new commercial headway thanks to the efforts of acts like Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias, Estefan reigned as the most successful crossover artist in Latin music history, with international record sales close to the 50 million mark. In 1999, she also made her feature film debut alongside Meryl Streep in Music of the Heart, recording the film&amp;#039;s title song as a duet with *NSYNC and scoring both a massive pop hit and an Oscar nomination in the process.\n\nReview\tby Jose F. Promis\n\nAbriendo Puertas (Opening Doors) is Gloria Estefan&amp;#039;s second Spanish-language album released in the U.S. Abriendo Puertas is about opening doors to the myriad Latin American cultures; therefore, this album features several different Latin styles of music from different parts of the world, including Venezuela, Cuba, Colombia, and the Caribbean. The music combines salsas, merengues, boleros, Afro-Cuban rhythms and chants, and other styles, resulting in a varied, sunny, and delightful album. This set differs from her other Spanish albums because at least half the songs are holiday tunes, with ample reference to Christmas and the New Year (the ballad &quot;Mas Alla&quot; even has Christmas bells in the background). In Latin America, Christmas is in summer, and so, in essence, this is a summer holiday album, which is quite an unusual concept for North American audiences. The songs are naturally positive, with well-meaning wishes for the New Year being a concurrent theme throughout the album. Estefan, as is always the case on her Spanish albums, sounds completely at ease with the material. The music on this album is traditional; therefore, there are no true American-style pop or club/dance songs, which is fine because the album should be taken and enjoyed for what it is -- a bright, multicultural Latin American semi-holiday album. \n\nEnjoy,","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cbbb8302fe8cfafa1fdce01ffe4cc81392207e6","amp;dn":"Gloria+Estefan+-+Abriendo+puertas+-+%281995%29%5BFLAC-EAC-CUE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cbbb8302fe8cfafa1fdce01ffe4cc81392207e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,187,184,48,47,232,207,175,161,253,206,1,255,228,204,129,57,34,7,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

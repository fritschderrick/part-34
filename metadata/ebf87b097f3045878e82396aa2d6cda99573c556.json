Published by IDW.\n\n**I dont own or take credit for any of the content contained in this torrent, all credit goes to the creator of the comic.**\n\n\nDescription:\n\nFed up with receiving poorly-written &quot;Twilight&quot; knockoffs, editor Shannon Wade did what any reasonable person would: she started killing the worst of the would-be authors sending them to her! Meanwhile, a stuttering, overweight vampire has targeted those who portray vampires in a light he deems unrealistic. Not exactly novel but terribly graphic, Done To Death follows Andy and Shannon's paths towards a collision as darkly funny as it is ridiculously violent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebf87b097f3045878e82396aa2d6cda99573c556","amp;dn":"Done+to+Death+%5BGraphic+Novel%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebf87b097f3045878e82396aa2d6cda99573c556","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,248,123,9,127,48,69,135,142,130,57,106,162,214,205,169,149,115,197,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

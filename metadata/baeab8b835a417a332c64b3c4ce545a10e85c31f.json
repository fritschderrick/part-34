The song Health and Wealth(13) is a perfect exapmle. We Americans are so materialistic and ethnocentric, they point it out. I think that some younger people will not understand such deeper lyrics but this is what's on his (Matt M.) mind. I like this album more than the previous two, mostly because of the different sounds of the songs. Again with each album the lyric content just becomes more meaningful. Dedication (5) this song talks about the sacrifice we make when sharing the gospel, another awesome song. Refuge is another song which I feel is so refreshing and a great way to conclude the album. It is just a song that calms me down when times get bad.

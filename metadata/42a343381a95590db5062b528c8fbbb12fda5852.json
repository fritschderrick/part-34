They are best known for their hit &quot;California Sun.&quot;\nThe Rivieras were made up of teenagers from South Bend Central High School. The group was originally called the Playmates, but was forced to change their names as there was already a group playing under that name. As a result, the group decided to rename themselves after the Buick Riviera. \nThe Rivieras were one of the many groups in America that became part of the &quot;frat rock&quot; movement in the early 1960s. The group had their greatest hit in 1964 with &quot;California Sun&quot;. It reached #5 in the main U.S. pop chart. In fact, &quot;California Sun&quot; was one of the last songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart before the &quot;British Invasion&quot;. The song has become a classic on &quot;oldies&quot; radio in North America over the years.\nBoth personal reasons and drastic changes in pop music led to the split-up of the group in 1966.\n\n\nPlease SEED and enjoy, thanks........!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42a343381a95590db5062b528c8fbbb12fda5852","amp;dn":"The+Rivieras-2+cd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42a343381a95590db5062b528c8fbbb12fda5852","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,163,67,56,26,149,89,13,181,6,43,82,140,143,187,177,47,218,88,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

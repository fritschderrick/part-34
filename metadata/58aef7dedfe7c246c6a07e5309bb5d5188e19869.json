[BOOTLEG]\nLabel: Empress Valley\nReleased: 2011\nFormat: Flac\nRecorded: Seattle Center Coliseum, Seattle, WA - March 17th, 1975\n\n\nA really superb show from the 1975 Tour. The sound is great and the playing is excellent. Robert Plant is in decent voice and the band is on a roll! The opening numbers are really powerful and No Quarter and Dazed And Confused are some of the best versions ever. Earlier shows on the tour (like the New York shows) were long but the marathons were generally played at 1973 length (No Quarter never exceeding twenty minutes, Dazed never exceeding thirty). On the west coast shows Led Zeppelin routinely expands the numbers to a near thirty minute No Quarter and a forty-minute Dazed And Confused. More highlights tonight include something happening onstage after Bonham's drum solo, causing Plant to start singing lines from Max Bygraves' &quot;You're A Pink Toothbrush&quot;. This song is nothing more than Plant singing what appears to be a commercial jingle and lasts only ten seconds but it's funny!\n\nDisc 1 (58:20)\n1 Rock And Roll, \n2 Sick Again, \n3 Over The Hills And Far Away, \n4 In My Time Of Dying, \n5 The Song Remains The Same, \n6 The Rain Song, \n7 Kashmir\n\nDisc 2 (58:03)\n1 No Quarter, \n2 Trampled Under Foot, \n3 Moby Dick\n\nDisc 3 (68:55)\n1 Dazed And Confused, \n2  Stairway To Heaven, \n3 Whole Lotta Love, \n4 Black Dog\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58aef7dedfe7c246c6a07e5309bb5d5188e19869","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+Havent+We+Met+Somewhere+Before%28rock%29%28bootleg%29%28flac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58aef7dedfe7c246c6a07e5309bb5d5188e19869","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,174,247,222,223,231,194,70,198,160,126,83,9,187,93,81,136,225,152,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

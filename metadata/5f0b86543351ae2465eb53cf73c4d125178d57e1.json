In his words, the Rock will fall like ripe fruit. La Roca is an epic Romeo and Juliet-type love story between the massive Rock of Gibraltar and its neighboring Spanish city of La Linea. Despite being declared enemies by their countries, they used to be inseparable. Eventually, indoctrination on both sides forced the separation of thousands of mixed families. Over 13 years families met at the border every Sunday to look through binoculars at their estranged lovers, brothers, parents and babies - screaming, Daddy loves you, from a distance.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease seed !!

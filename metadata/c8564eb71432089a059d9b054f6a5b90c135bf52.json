A very personal story that is both funny and poignant, TORCH SONG TRILOGY chronicles a New Yorker's search for love, respect and tradition in a world that seems not especially made for him. From Arnold's hilarious steps toward domestic bliss with a reluctant school teacher, to his first truly promising love affair with a young fashion model, Arnold's greatest challenge remains his complicated relationship with his mother. But armed with a keenly developed sense of humor and oftentimes piercing wit, Arnold continues to test the commonly accepted terms of endearment--and endurance--in a universally affecting story that confirms that happiness is well worth carrying a torch for.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8564eb71432089a059d9b054f6a5b90c135bf52","amp;dn":"Torch+Song+Trilogy+1988.DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8564eb71432089a059d9b054f6a5b90c135bf52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,86,78,183,20,50,8,154,5,157,155,5,79,106,91,144,193,53,191,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

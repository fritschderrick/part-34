He brings their lives and ideas to life in entertaining and accessible fashion. Far from being a novelty, each book is a highly refined appraisal of the writer and his work, authoritative and clearly presented.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:566d0134472df8d8c87adff34ed775b792048d2f","amp;dn":"BECKETT+IN+90+MINUTES+-+Paul+Strathern+-+Samuel+Beckett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"566d0134472df8d8c87adff34ed775b792048d2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,109,1,52,71,45,248,216,200,122,223,243,78,215,117,183,146,4,141,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Just as other scriptural religions, Islam has produced a long tradition of interpretation for its holy book. Nevertheless, efforts to introduce the Qur'an and its intellectual heritage to English-speaking audiences have been hampered by the lack of available resources. \n\nThe Cambridge Companion to the Qur'an seeks to remedy that situation. In a discerning summation of the field, Jane McAuliffe brings together an international team of scholars to explain its complexities. Comprising fourteen chapters, each devoted to a topic of central importance, the book is rich in historical, \n\nlinguistic and literary detail, while also reflecting the influence of other disciplines. For both the university student and the general reader, The Cambridge Companion to the Qur'an provides a fascinating entree to a text that has shaped the lives of millions for centuries.\n\nTitle: The Cambridge Companion to the Qur'an (Cambridge Companions to Religion)\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press\nYear: 2006\nFormat: PDF\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!

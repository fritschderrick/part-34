Have played about halfway through the team sonic story and all looks to be good. The game seems to run better as a ps2 classic than my actual ps2 copy. Works on Rebug 4.21 and above as well as Rogero 4.41. Comes with instructions on how to properly install.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:777a0c11a3feb9027bac401c9b925768810e3343","amp;dn":"Sonic+Heroes+-+Custom+PKG+for+%5BPS3%5D+%28PS2+classics%29+4.21%2B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"777a0c11a3feb9027bac401c9b925768810e3343","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,122,12,17,163,254,185,2,123,172,64,28,155,146,87,104,129,14,51,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

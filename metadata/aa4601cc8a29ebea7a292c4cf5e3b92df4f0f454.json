Finding drivers etc for old PCs can be frustrating so I thought I'd share this in case it was of any use to somebody.\n\nThe CD contains the full MS-DOS 6.2 &amp; Windows 3.1 installation along with various other programs that came pre-installed. It includes UK English, German, and Dutch languages - I think it is automatically selected depending on which model system you have.\n\nThe restore program will only run on supported PCs unfortunately.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa4601cc8a29ebea7a292c4cf5e3b92df4f0f454","amp;dn":"Compaq+Presario+7100+series+QuickRestore+CD+%26amp%3B+Floppy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa4601cc8a29ebea7a292c4cf5e3b92df4f0f454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,70,1,204,138,41,235,234,122,41,44,76,245,227,185,45,244,240,244,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

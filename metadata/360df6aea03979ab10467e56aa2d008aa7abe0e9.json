Released as the album's second single, it reached #13 on the US singles chart. \n\nRecording of &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot; (as 'Waiting for a Friend') began in late 1972 through early 1973 in Kingston, Jamaica, during the Goats Head Soup sessions when the band still had Taylor as a member, but his guitar part did not make it to the overdubbing sessions in April 1981 when the song was selected by Tattoo You producer Chris Kimsey as one the band could re-work for the album. This leaves Keith Richards distinct electric guitar part the only guitar on the recording.\n\nThe video, directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg (who also directed their 1968 special The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus), became very popular on MTV and featured reggae artist Peter Tosh sitting on a stoop with Jagger who is seen waiting for Keith Richards. The building is found at 96-98 St. Mark's Place in Manhattan, which is the same building featured on the album cover of Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti.\n\nReleased as the second single after &quot;Start Me Up,&quot; &quot;Waiting on a Friend&quot; became a radio staple in the US where it reached #13 on the singles chart in early-1982. It did not fare as well in Europe, reaching only #50 on the UK Singles Chart but as high as #9 in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. In the vanguard of the British Invasion of bands that became popular in the US from 1964 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 65 and symbols of rebellious youth, the Rolling Stones were also instrumental in making blues a major part of rock and roll, and of changing the international focus of blues culture to the more primitive blues typified by John Lee Hooker and by Chess Records artists such as Muddy Waters, writer of &quot;Rollin' Stone&quot;, the song after which the band is named.\n\nThe Rolling Stones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them fourth on the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; list and their estimated album sales are above 200 million. They have released twenty-four studio albums, eleven live albums and numerous compilations. Sticky Fingers (1971) was their first of eight consecutive number one studio albums in the United States. In 2008 the Rolling Stones ranked 10th on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists&quot; chart.\n(video has a semi-transparent white &quot;vh1 classic&quot; logo at the bottom right)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_on_a_Friend&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_on_a_Friend&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaPIeaaEh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaPIeaaEh&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: MPEG Digital Audio 48000Hz stereo 384kbps\n   Duration: 00:04:24\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.

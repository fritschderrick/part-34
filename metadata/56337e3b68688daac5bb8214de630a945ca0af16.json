The goal is to create a stable economy and a strong military to defend against invaders, destroy enemy castles and accomplish the mission objectives.\n\nStronghold contains several modes of gameplay, with both combat based and economic missions. The main game mode is the military campaign, which is based upon a map of Great Britain. The backstory to the campaign begins when the King invades a barbarian enemy, where the King is captured and held for ransom. Four Lords take control of the Kingdom, dividing it into their personal territories. The player is represented by a young, inexperienced commander, whose father is killed in an ambush by the one of the villains, helped by two lords remaining loyal to the king. The player then has to regain control of the Kingdom, re-gaining control of one county each mission. The player has to defeat each of the four Lords in the campaign, receiving help from the King once he has been successfully ransomed mid-game. An economic campaign is set after the main campaign, where the player re-constructs parts of the Kingdom. The player is set goals to complete against a variety of obstacles, such as bandits and fire.\n\nOther game modes are one-mission combat and economic scenarios, where the player has to complete either military or economic goals. A Siege mode is included in the game, where the player may attack or defend several historical castles. Free build mode is another game mode; here the player has the option of building a castle without any objectives. More scenarios can be created for the game by the inbuilt map editor.\n\n\nFeatures\n\nIn order to survive, the player is required to construct a castle, building the individual buildings and the castle walls and towers. The player is also left to determine which buildings are vital and which can be left outside the castle to be destroyed in the event of an attack. There are also options to create soldiers to defend the castle, and to eventually attack and defeat an enemy.\n\nIn order to create a stable economy and gather resources, the player is required to maintain a positive popularity level with his peasants; failure to do so will result in peasants leaving the castle and subsequent economic collapse. Popularity can be maintained by keeping adequate housing, low taxes, high food rations, a supply of ale and encouraging religion. Popularity can also be affected by the creation of structures to inspire fear or love: facilities of torture and execution will increase worker efficiency but reduce popularity and military units' effectiveness, presumably due to bad morale; while parks, statues and shrines will have the opposite effects.\n\nThe game differs from many other similar games as the player is required to process resources through a number of facilities before they can be used for a certain purpose. To create an army, a player must not only have free peasants, but must process the resources required for their weapons through appropriate workshops, rather than simply spend the resources required at a barracks. For example, some resources, like wood, require only a peasant to chop down a tree and turn the logs into lumber. Others, such as bread, require the harvesting of wheat, the production of flour, the production of bread, and then consumption. With enough gold, certain stages of production can be bypassed by buying the resources from the market building. In the bread production for example, flour can be bought and turned into bread by bakeries, thereby skipping two stages.\n\nCombat\n\nCombat in Stronghold is based on a strength and hit point system. There are a variety of unit types in the game, with each unit being stronger, and hence more expensive, than the preceding unit. Stronghold contains both melee units, such as the basic spearman and the stronger swordsman, and ranged units such as archers. The game also contains support troops such as engineers, who provide additional combat options like constructing siege engines. Unlike other strategy games there are no counters for units, and units do not take up space, allowing them to overlap each other. Several non-combat characters can fight against enemy units, although most have no ability to fight. Injured soldiers remain injured for the rest of the game, there is no healing system.\n\nFire\n\nFire plays a main role in the Stronghold storyline, as in certain missions, igniting pitch is almost necessary for survival. Also, there are certain trigger events that start fires. Fires spread very quickly, and a flaming building can ignite people or other buildings. Fires will only go out if all sources of fuel are consumed, or if the fire itself is extinguished by fire watches. Fires can spread over small boundaries of water.\n\nIn most RTS games, fire appears on buildings as an indicator of damage; for example, if a building is damaged enough it would catch fire, but sustain no damage from that fire. In Stronghold, buildings that are damaged by siege weapons or are torn down would not catch fire; instead, they lose hit points until they collapse, with the indication of damage being visible signs of cracks and damage throughout the building. However, boiling oil pots, if destroyed, would start a small fire where they were built.\n\nWalls\n\nWalls in Stronghold are unique from most other RTS games that include walls, because towers and walls by themselves do nothing other than stop enemy troops and peasants. Troops may be placed on top of towers and walls, and will proceed to fire with a height advantage. Walls are not bound by set hit points; if a rock hits a wall in one section at a certain location, then the wall assumes a &quot;damaged&quot; state; the wall is lowered. Once the wall is low enough, troops (and projectiles) can move over walls. Towers have set hit points, meaning that once a certain degree of damage is achieved, the tower will collapse. Towers in Stronghold have a visual indicator of damage in the forms of impact holes and craters in the walls. If a tower or gatehouse has been damaged, there are no enemy troops in the area and there is a sufficient amount of stone in the stockpile, it can be repaired at a cost of the amount of stone necessary.\n\nMap Editor\n\nThe map editor in Stronghold is also unique. In the editor, time passes as if the game were being played; trees grow, deer move, wolves attack, etc. Also, the editor is quite simple, though beautiful maps can be created. Soldiers placed within the map can be ordered to move about as if the game were being played. Soldiers can also attack, which can be a nuisance at times when a map maker attempts to put units close to one another; however the map can be paused using Alt+H ('P' in game), eliminating this problem. Scripted events and others are included within a special menu; every function is explained.\n\nCharacters\n\n    * The Lord: The lord of the player's castle, and also the most important character. If the Lord falls in battle, then the game is over.\n          o Lord Woolsack: Lord Woolsack is a trusted advisor. Since the player's father died in the ambush, Woolsack has looked after the player. He is a bit on the careful side, and will scold the player when he takes too many risks. Lord Woolsack and Sir Longarm spend a lot of time in dispute about how the player should conduct himself.\n          o Sir Longarm: Sir Longarm is an old warhorse. He's an accomplished soldier and will carry out missions elsewhere in the kingdom while the player is busy fighting his own battles. He and Lord Woolsack don't agree on all things and often he will push the player to take more risks than might be prudent.\n          o The King: The king is seen only once near the end of the military campaign, though he is mentioned several times throughout the game.\n    * Duc de Puce &quot;The Rat&quot;: The Rat was raised as an only child in lands belonging to the de Puce family. The duke showed his mother favour, ensuring that she never paid taxes and always had enough to get by. One day a messenger came by and it was revealed that his father was the Duc de Puce, for whom his mother once worked as a serving wench. Due to an unfortunate accident, the entire de Puce family was lost at sea while returning from holiday, leaving the Rat next in line to inherit the title of Duke. The Rat is a childish sort of character - any setback will cause him to lose his cool in a spectacular way, and he gets nervous as the player claims more and more of his counties. The Rat holds the southern counties of England and is the first of the enemy lords to be beaten. The Rat's troops wear orange.\n    * Duc Beauregard &quot;The Snake&quot;: The Snake was once governor of some of the richest provinces in the homeland, where he made an extremely fruitful living by under-declaring the taxes he collected. When the king found out, he had the Snake posted to the 'new colonies'. During one of his first military encounters, the Snake went up against the LordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father and lost an eye to him in combat. On that day, the Snake swore he would not rest until the decapitated heads of the player's entire family were lined up on spikes outside his keep. The Snake is a conniving enemy. At one stage he offers the player help against the troops of the Rat, but he does so for a price, like everything he does. He is confident at first; however, once the player begins to surpass him he will start to panic. The bulk of the Snake's land is in Wales, though he secures one of the Rat's counties during the campaign. The Snake's troops wear yellow.\n    * Duc Truffe &quot;The Pig&quot;: When the Pig was born it is rumoured he appeared so hideous that his parents abandoned him in the street. Whatever the case, it is known that he was taken in by a group of travelling bandits who raided small towns and villages throughout the land. While growing up with this small army of rogues he was vastly underfed, but after developing a crude but effective understanding of basic military tactics and being nominated as the rogues' leader, the Pig made sure he had the best food after each raid and has overeaten ever since. The Pig is a brute. When he talks to the player, the player can almost feel the bits of food and spittle flying in his face. He is vindictive and has little patience with fools. The only one he's somewhat afraid of is the Wolf. The Pig primarily controls the East Midland counties. The Pig's troops wear red.\n    * Duc Volpe &quot;The Wolf&quot;: The Wolf's past is shrouded in mystery, and what is known of his history is mainly patched together from stories and unreliable rumours. It is believed that both his parents died from natural causes in close succession shortly after his eighteenth birthday. Cold and raging inside, the Wolf is the player's worst enemy. He puts up with the presence of the other dukes, but none of them approach his level of depravity and hate for the player. He is the most dangerous of the game's enemies. It is revealed near the end of the campaign that he is responsible for the player's father's death. The campaign ends when the player takes the Wolf's castle and slays him, avenging his father's death. The Wolf holds the northernmost counties of England, and his troops wear black.\n\nPlease SEED!\n\nsorry for not seeding my hard drive burn out Now I am back up and seeding!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56337e3b68688daac5bb8214de630a945ca0af16","amp;dn":"Stronghold","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56337e3b68688daac5bb8214de630a945ca0af16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,51,126,59,104,104,141,170,197,187,130,20,222,99,10,148,92,160,175,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

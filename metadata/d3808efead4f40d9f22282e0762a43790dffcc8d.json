A group of seemingly humanistic trucks take over a truck stop and starts killing everything in sight. The remaining townsfolk must band together and come up with a way to murder the inanimate objects, a seemingly difficult task considering the abnormal circumstances. A remake of King&amp;#039;s MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE.\n\nCredits \nCast: Brendan Fletcher, Timothy Busfield \nDirector: Chris Thomson \nProducer: Derek Mazur \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3808efead4f40d9f22282e0762a43790dffcc8d","amp;dn":"Trucks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3808efead4f40d9f22282e0762a43790dffcc8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,128,142,254,173,79,64,217,242,34,130,224,118,42,67,121,13,255,204,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

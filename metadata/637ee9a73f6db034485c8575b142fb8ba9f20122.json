She puts the English national character under her anthropological microscope, and finds a strange and fascinating culture, governed by complex sets of unspoken rules and byzantine codes of behaviour. The rules of weather-speak. The ironic-gnome rule. The reflex apology rule. The paranoid-pantomime rule. Class indicators and class anxiety tests. The money-talk taboo and many more... Through a mixture of anthropological analysis and her own unorthodox experiments (using herself as a reluctant guinea-pig), Kate Fox discovers what these unwritten behaviour codes tell us about Englishness.\n\n\n\nBook's contest: Introduction - Anthropology at Home Part One: Conversation Codes (The Weather, Grooming-talk, Humour Rules, Linguistic Class Codes, Emerging Talk-rules: The Mobile Phone, Pub-talk) Part Two: Behaviour Codes (Home Rules, Rules of the Road, Work to Rule, Rules of Play, Dress Codes, Food Rules, Rules of Sex, Rites of Passage)\nRead more at http://www.heroturko.me/ebooks/711984-watching-the-english-the-hidden-rules-of-english-behaviour.html#SoZfwsckCYMmtlBf.99\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:637ee9a73f6db034485c8575b142fb8ba9f20122","amp;dn":"Watching+The+English%3A+The+Hidden+Rules+of+English+Behaviour.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"637ee9a73f6db034485c8575b142fb8ba9f20122","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,126,233,167,63,109,176,52,72,92,133,117,177,66,251,139,169,242,1,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Melodic, heavy grooves dominate their recently released debut album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœRiseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. With a classic hard-rock soul and alternative-rock sensibilities, the band delivers passionate, hard-driving performances in both the studio and on stage. The members of Devilstrip are fully committed to the mantra of &quot;100% or nothing&quot; in all that bears their name. This has earned them an ever-growing, rabid regional fan base and now gaining international recognition in the United Kingdom, South America, Australia and beyond. A tour is on the horizon to support Ã¢â‚¬ËœRiseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which is now available at CD baby, iTunes, Amazon and pretty much everywhere else.

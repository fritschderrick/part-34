For me, that means searching out and collecting anything current, Christian related of course, from Worship to Screamo.  From Alternative to Gospel.  From Reggae to Rap.  Most of which I will never personally listen to, but happily archive so I can include them in these bundles for others to enjoy.\n\nAnd aside from the bundles themselves, I've also been torrenting here on The Pirate Bay since 2009.  And elsewhere online for much longer than that.\n\nMy collection has grown so large that I recently had to build a secondary desktop computer with three individual internal 3 terabyte drives, just so that I could continue onward with this ministry.  I haven't yet migrated over to the new desktop, but will need to shortly as I don't have a lot of faith in my external backup drives.\n\nAll of that to say I've been struggling with the direction I feel God wants me to take.  Sure I know this music is appreciated.  So long as God is glorified, nothing else matters.  Amen?  But I could use a little encouragement.  So if you've not yet said &quot;hi&quot;, please consider doing so in this thread today.  And if you would sooner remain anonymous, I can certainty appreciate that too.  Please pray for that direction for me.\n\nNow, on to the bundle itself.  There are lots of tasty morsels of music in this one.  Audio Adrenaline, Greater Allen Cathedral, One Republic, Starflyer 59, Switchfoot, Vineyard, etc.  There's sure to be something for everyone.\n\nAnd as always, for those keeping count, we're now up to 513 releases for 2013.\n\nThis 20th bundle includes the following 22 titles...\n\n * Almost, The - 2013 - Fear Inside Our Bones\n * At The Wayside - 2013 - Thanks To You - Single\n * Audio Adrenaline - 2013 - Big House To Ocean Floor\n * Begging Sea, The - 2013 - The Distance\n * Canton Junction - 2013 - Show Me Your Way\n * Dunwells, The - 2013 - Follow The Road\n * Erica Campbell - 2013 - A Little More Jesus - Single\n * Ghost Ship - 2013 - The Good King\n * Greater Allen Cathedral - 2013 - Rev Floyd Flake Presents The Worship Experience\n * Guvna B - 2013 - Odd 1 Out\n * Lisa Page Brooks - 2013 - Ready\n * Matt Genese - 2013 - Salvage\n * One Republic - 2013 - Native - Deluxe Edition\n * Patrice Moore - 2013 - You Can Do It\n * PJ Anderson - 2013 - Let Your Light Shine\n * Rebecca Friedlander - 2013 - Awaken\n * Starflyer 59 - 2013 - Iamaceo\n * Switchfoot - 2013 - Playlist - The Very Best Of Switchfoot\n * Tre9 - 2013 - Missionary Minded\n * Turning Point, The - 2013 - Lift II\n * Victory Fellowship - 2013 - Heavenward Live Worship\n * Vineyard - 2013 - Roots Worship - Live At The Trash Bar\n\nPraising Him,\nTorrentTracts - June 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02e3ba5769733e7fac240b84cea9ee7a3a3b1bb6","amp;dn":"2013+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+20%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02e3ba5769733e7fac240b84cea9ee7a3a3b1bb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,227,186,87,105,115,62,127,172,36,11,132,206,169,238,122,58,59,27,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

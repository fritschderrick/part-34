Whitehead.  Largely forgotten, objective relativism provided a metaphysical framework, based upon an ontology of events and relations rather than substances and discrete properties, that has continued relevance for contemporary metaphysical discussions.  In this thesis, I attempt to chart the boundaries and pathways of this ontology, outlining what Dewey calls the Ã¢â‚¬Å“ground-map of the province of criticism.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  In particular, the ground-map of objective relativism is invoked to situate and analyze the model of psycho-physical emergence outlined in DeweyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Experience and Nature.  Because it is a relational ontology, objective relativism avoids problems with emergence common to substantival models.  Additional analyses of its ontological premises, both in DeweyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writings and elsewhere, demonstrate how compelling accounts of causation, consciousness, and meaning may be formulated within this model.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49706c1233b3d671db0ffd9cc417e981e0b47fed","amp;dn":"PJ+Taylor+-+2013+-+A+Pragmatic+Realism+-+Events%2C+Powers%2C+and+Rel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49706c1233b3d671db0ffd9cc417e981e0b47fed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,112,108,18,51,179,214,113,219,15,253,156,196,23,233,129,224,180,127,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

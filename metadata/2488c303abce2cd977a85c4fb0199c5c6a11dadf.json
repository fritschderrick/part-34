Constructed as a loose concept album about an androgynous alien rock star named Ziggy Stardust, the story falls apart quickly, yet Bowie's fractured, paranoid lyrics are evocative of a decadent, decaying future, and the music echoes an apocalyptic, nuclear dread. Fleshing out the off-kilter metallic mix with fatter guitars, genuine pop songs, string sections, keyboards, and a cinematic flourish, Ziggy Stardust is a glitzy array of riffs, hooks, melodrama, and style and the logical culmination of glam. Mick Ronson plays with a maverick flair that invigorates rockers like &quot;Suffragette City,&quot; &quot;Moonage Daydream,&quot; and &quot;Hang Onto Yourself,&quot; while &quot;Lady Stardust,&quot; &quot;Five Years,&quot; and &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Suicide&quot; have a grand sense of staged drama previously unheard of in rock &amp; roll. And that self-conscious sense of theater is part of the reason why Ziggy Stardust sounds so foreign. Bowie succeeds not in spite of his pretensions but because of them, and Ziggy Stardust -- familiar in structure, but alien in performance -- is the first time his vision and execution met in such a grand, sweeping fashion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2488c303abce2cd977a85c4fb0199c5c6a11dadf","amp;dn":"David+Bowie+-+The+Rise+and+Fall...+%281972%29+%5B24+bit++FLAC%5D+%5Bvinyl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2488c303abce2cd977a85c4fb0199c5c6a11dadf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,136,195,3,171,206,44,217,119,168,92,79,176,25,156,92,106,17,218,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

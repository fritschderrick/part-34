This course covers using the Structure pane and Tags panel, understanding and writing code for integration into InDesign and external editors, and ultimately, adding dynamic content to pages with XML. The skills learned in this course will be applied directly to two real-world projects that are included in the final chapters: building a product sheet and a longer book. Exercise files accompany the course.\nTopics include:\n\nUnderstanding XML terminology\nIdentifying XML elements, attributes, and comments\nAdding, moving, and deleting elements\nTagging and styling\nCreating tables with XML\nBuilding frame and flow layouts\nOrdering with XSLT\nUsing the Document Type Definition in an XML workflow\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b257f295e5148663aeb0ba5e500fb4b873beb5e5","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+InDesign+CS%3A+Dynamic+Publishing+Workflows+in+XML+with+Ji","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b257f295e5148663aeb0ba5e500fb4b873beb5e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,87,242,149,229,20,134,99,174,176,186,94,80,15,180,184,115,190,181,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

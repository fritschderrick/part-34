A booming mining town that grew up around unbelievably rich veins of Ember, that rare ore with the power to enchant--or corrupt--everything it touches. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a powerful thing, and everyone knows power, well. Power can corrupt, too. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll set out into the nearby mountains and depths below to discover the full extent of EmberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s influence on the civilizations that have come before.\nChoose from among three character classes, and venture from the safety of the town of Torchlight into randomly generated dungeon levels, with a huge variety of creepy monsters, endless variations of loot to find, and quests to complete. The endless randomization ensures that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never be playing the same game twice. A fun, crunchy action-RPG, this one game that oozes style, care, and polish out of every single pixel and is a definite must to pick up if you like RPGs or just having some mindless fun.\nCheck out the bewildering bevy of mods all in our Mod Spotlight for Torchlight.\nOver 30 randomized levels! Monsters, treasures, puzzles, and items are also different each time you embark on an adventure.\nChoose a pet that will level up, fight by your side, and even take items back into town to sell them for you!\nIncludes TorchED for you to make your own Torchlight set dungeons, mods, and much, much more!\n\nMinimum system requirements\nWindows: Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7\n1.8 GHz Processor\n512MB RAM (1 GB recommended)\n3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 9.0c\n400MB HDD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c44c552df6d58351af3c9db170eb5bf112fb3711","amp;dn":"Torchlight+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c44c552df6d58351af3c9db170eb5bf112fb3711","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,76,85,45,246,213,131,81,175,60,157,177,112,235,91,241,18,251,55,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

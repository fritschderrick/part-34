The only difference: he's also an amateur detective. Determined to make his absent father proud, he uses the skills he's learned playing video games to solve mysteries. \n\nOnly he's no Sherlock Holmes. Or Encyclopedia Brown. Or even Scooby-Doo. When the school bully is framed for filling the orchestra teacher's tuba with macaroni and cheese, Clueless is on the case. But can he catch the culprit before he strikes again? \n\nHis only obstacle, as Jeff Mack shows us in his hilarious new illustrated series, is his own ineptitude . . . questionable talent . . . and limited intelligence. No problem!\n\nGenre: Humor | Children / Middle Grade","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22ec07a097294678b18966eebbb21972f79cbcf5","amp;dn":"Clueless+McGee+by+Jeff+Mack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22ec07a097294678b18966eebbb21972f79cbcf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,236,7,160,151,41,70,120,177,137,102,238,187,178,25,114,247,156,188,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

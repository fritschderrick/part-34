The name stands for \\\\\\&quot;Operating System/2,\\\\\\&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM\\\\\\'s \\\\\\&quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)\\\\\\&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t\n\nMicrosoft Operating System/2 versoin 1.1\ninstall.bat\t\t(disk1/7)\ndisk1.bat\t\t(disk2/7)\ndisk2.bat\t\t(disk3/7)\ndisk3.bat\t\t(disk4/7)\ndisk4.bat\t\t(disk5/7)\ndriver1.bat\t\t(disk6/7)\ndualboot.bat\t\t(disk7/7)\nos2_lan1.bat\t\tMS Lan Manager XNS OPTION OS/2 Drivers #1\nos2_lan2.bat\t\tMS Lan Manager XNS OPTION OS/2 Drivers #2\ndos_lan\t\t\tMS Lan Manager XNS OPTION Dos Drivers  (OBS! 720Kb disk)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d7d9b28415bc4a11cd299ccd709b09cab9e1b26","amp;dn":"Microsoft+OS2+1.1+-+English+-+Diskettes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d7d9b28415bc4a11cd299ccd709b09cab9e1b26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,125,155,40,65,91,196,161,28,210,153,204,215,9,176,156,171,158,27,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

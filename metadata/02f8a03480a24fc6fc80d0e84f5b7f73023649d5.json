He is high priest and emperor, a man whose power, wit, and charm are all that preserves a tenuous peace. But Prisms never last, and Guile knows exactly how long he has left to live: Five years to achieve five impossible goals.\n\nBut when Guile discovers he has a son, born in a far kingdom after the war that put him in power, he must decide how much he's willing to pay to protect a secret that could tear his world apart.The Black Prism is the first book of a new trilogy by New York Times bestselling author Brent Weeks. Noted for his gritty anti-hero characters in The Night Angel trilogy, Weeks brings some of the same sensibilities to this new series, while also treading new ground.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02f8a03480a24fc6fc80d0e84f5b7f73023649d5","amp;dn":"Brent+Weeks+-+%5BLightbringer+01%5D+-+The+Black+Prism+%28Fantasy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02f8a03480a24fc6fc80d0e84f5b7f73023649d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,248,160,52,128,162,79,198,252,128,208,232,79,91,127,115,2,54,73,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

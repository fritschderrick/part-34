The rabbi explains to Jose that due to the celebration of the Passover festivities, together with a few other factors, if Nora is not buried that same day, they will have to wait almost five days to be able to carry out the burial. It turns out that before she died, Nora devised a Machiavellian plan in order for him to take care of her funeral. But she missed something, a mysterious photograph left under the bed will lead to an unexpected outcome which will remind us that sometimes the greatest love stories are hidden in the smallest places","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29f7f1d7ae988c8cd4b9d9ebf1d41199a643f4d9","amp;dn":"Cinco+d%26iacute%3Bas+sin+Nora+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29f7f1d7ae988c8cd4b9d9ebf1d41199a643f4d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,247,241,215,174,152,140,140,212,185,217,235,241,212,17,153,166,67,244,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

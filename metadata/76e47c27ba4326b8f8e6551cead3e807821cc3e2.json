A power ballad, it was released in 1989 as the second single from Warrant's debut album Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich. The song was Warrant's most successful single, reaching #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #3 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and spawned a popular video starring Scottish model Tracy Allan.\n\nThe song was re done in 1999 on the Greatest &amp; Latest album.\n\nDirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich is the debut studio album by American glam metal band Warrant, released in 1989.\n\nThe album was highly successful, spawning the hit singles &quot;Heaven&quot; (#2, 1989), &quot;Down Boys&quot; (#27, 1989) and &quot;Sometimes She Cries&quot; (#20, 1990).\n\nThe album's sound is typical of the Sunset Strip glam metal scene of the 1980s, featuring heavy guitars and melodic, catchy choruses.\n\nThe album's themes, which include materialism (&quot;32 Pennies&quot;, &quot;D.R.F.S.R&quot;), sex (&quot;Down Boys&quot;, &quot;So Damn Pretty&quot;, &quot;Cold Sweat&quot;), heartbreak (&quot;Heaven&quot;) and loneliness (&quot;Sometimes She Cries&quot;), would be echoed on later Warrant releases.\n\nThe smash hit &quot;Heaven&quot; took Warrant's record company by surprise. Indeed, once the widespread appeal of the song became apparent, the band were instructed to re-record the track to lend it a &quot;bigger radio sound&quot;. The first 250,000 copies of the record featured the original version while later pressings featured a new version. &quot;Heaven&quot; had previously been recorded by Jani Lane and Steven Sweet's old band Plain Jane.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76e47c27ba4326b8f8e6551cead3e807821cc3e2","amp;dn":"Warrant+-+Heaven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76e47c27ba4326b8f8e6551cead3e807821cc3e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,228,124,39,186,67,38,184,248,230,85,28,234,211,232,7,130,28,195,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Parker acquired the nickname &quot;Yardbird&quot; early in his career, and the shortened form &quot;Bird&quot; remained Parker's sobriquet for the rest of his life, inspiring the titles of a number of Parker compositions, such as &quot;Yardbird Suite&quot; and &quot;Ornithology.&quot;\nParker also became an icon for the hipster subculture and later the Beat generation, personifying the conception of the jazz musician as an uncompromising artist and intellectual, rather than just a popular entertainer. His style ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from a rhythmic, harmonic and soloing perspective ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ influenced countless peers on every instrument. Like Louis Armstrong before him, Parker changed the sound of jazz music forever.\nJohn Birks &quot;Dizzy&quot; Gillespie was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, singer, and composer. He was born in Cheraw, South Carolina, the youngest of nine children. Dizzy's father, James, was a local bandleader, so instruments were made available to Dizzy. He started to play the piano at the age of 4. Together with Charlie Parker, he was a major figure in the development of bebop and modern jazz.\nIn addition to featuring in these epochal moments in bebop, he was instrumental in founding Afro-Cuban jazz, the modern jazz version of what early-jazz pioneer Jelly Roll Morton referred to as the &quot;Spanish Tinge&quot;. Gillespie was a trumpet virtuoso and gifted improviser, building on the virtuoso style of Roy Eldridge but adding layers of harmonic complexity previously unknown in jazz. In addition to his instrumental skills, Dizzy's beret and horn-rimmed spectacles, his scat singing, his bent horn, pouched cheeks and his light-hearted personality were essential in popularizing bebop. He had an enormous impact on subsequent trumpeters, both by the example of his playing and as a mentor to younger musicians.\nSo, one night, decades ago in 1947, these two guys met at Carnegie Hall and recorded this fantastic album, along with John Lewis on piano, Al McKibbon on bass, Joe Harris on drums, Elmon Wroght, Mathew McKayDave Burns and Ray Orr on trumpets, Taswell Baird and William Shepherd on tormbones, John Brown and Howard Johnson on alto saxes, James Moody and Joe Gayles on tenor saxes, Cecyl Payne on baritone sax, Milt Jackson on vibes, Chano Pozo on congas, Lorenzo Salan on bongos and Kenny &quot;Pancho&quot; Hagood on vocal.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.

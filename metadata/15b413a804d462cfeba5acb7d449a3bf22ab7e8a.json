Douglas Pistoia is looking for work, but only a private security firm, Multicorps Security, has offered him a job. Soon after he signs up, the UN decides to outsource its peacekeeping missions, and Multicorps wins the first bid, propelling Douglas into a war that is not his own, a highly sophisticated war broadcast worldwide by the soldiers themselves, thanks to the micro-cameras in their helmets. They are called the Cyclops. Douglas plays the game, and slowly emerges as both a unit leader and a media celebrity. But how far will he go in exploring the boundaries between war and peacekeeping, news and entertainment?\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://comicattack.net/2010/12/archaia-cyclops-1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://comicattack.net/2010/12/archaia-cyclops-1/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/49-37685/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/49-37685/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://comicbookrealm.co","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15b413a804d462cfeba5acb7d449a3bf22ab7e8a","amp;dn":"Cyclops","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15b413a804d462cfeba5acb7d449a3bf22ab7e8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,180,19,168,4,212,98,207,235,165,172,183,212,73,163,191,34,171,126,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Nancy Elizabeth will gain immediate and widespread comparison to Joanna Newsom, because alongside her many other instruments (acoustic guitar, harmonium, dulcimer, etc.), she plays a small Celtic harp on much of Battle and Victory. However, Cunliffe is a much less affected vocalist and far more down to earth in terms of her music and lyrics. A more appropriate comparison among her contemporaries would be Sharron Kraus, but at heart, Cunliffe belongs alongside the likes of Vashti Bunyan and Sandy Denny: traditional British folk music is at the heart of these songs, but she's never hidebound by tradition. &quot;Coriander&quot; features the Balkan-inspired avant-rock of her labelmates A Hawk and a Hacksaw percolating behind her lovely vocal, with accordion and horns powering the whole. Elsewhere, &quot;Hey Son&quot; features a piercing, Joni Mitchell-like lead vocal, and dreamy overdubbed harmonies over an oddly tuned, hypnotic acoustic guitar riff that explodes into dramatic Fairport Convention-style full band folk-rock. Endlessly inventive but based on a solid melodic and lyrical core, these songs are almost too rich to absorb in a single sitting. Battle and Victory is a deeply satisfying debut that vaults over the currently hip &quot;weird folk&quot; scene into something more lasting.\n\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/07/11/nancy-elizabeth/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f49d75f0be3d0a1145e7c961f26f050154f5745","amp;dn":"Nancy+Elizabeth...Battle+And+Victory%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f49d75f0be3d0a1145e7c961f26f050154f5745","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,73,215,95,11,227,208,161,20,94,124,150,31,38,240,80,21,79,87,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

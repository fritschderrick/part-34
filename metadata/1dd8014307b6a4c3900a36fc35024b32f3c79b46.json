Turner was a resilient figure in the history of blues ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he effortlessly spanned boogie-woogie, jump blues, even the first wave of rock &amp; roll, enjoying great success in each genre.\nTurner, whose powerful physique certainly matched his vocal might, was a product of the swinging, wide-open Kansas City scene. Even in his teens, the big-boned Turner looked entirely mature enough to gain entry to various K.C. niteries. He ended up simultaneously tending bar and singing the blues before hooking up with boogie piano master Pete Johnson during the early '30s. Theirs was a partnership that would endure for 13 years.\nAs 1938 came to a close, Turner and Johnson waxed the thundering &quot;Roll 'Em Pete&quot; for Vocalion. It was a thrilling up-tempo number anchored by Johnson's crashing 88s, and Turner would re-record it many times over the decades. Turner and Johnson waxed their seminal blues &quot;Cherry Red&quot; the next year for Vocalion with trumpeter Hot Lips Page and a full combo in support. In 1940, the massive shouter moved over to Decca and cut &quot;Piney Brown Blues&quot; with Johnson rippling the ivories. But not all of Turner's Decca sides teamed him with Johnson; Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith accompanied him on the mournful &quot;Careless Love,&quot; while Freddie Slack's Trio provided backing for &quot;Rocks in My Bed&quot; in 1941.\n\nAlthough health problems and the size of his humongous frame forced him to sit down during his latter-day performances, Turner continued to tour until shortly before his death in 1985. They called him the Boss of the Blues, and the appellation was truly a fitting one: when Turner shouted a lyric, you were definitely at his beck and call.\n\nTracklist [Recording Date,Personnel]\n1.

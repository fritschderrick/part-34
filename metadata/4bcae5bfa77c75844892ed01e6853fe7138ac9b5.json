It provides protection for your computer, with anti-virus, firewall and VPN services. It doesn't have the best detection rates, based on online reviews, but I use it on an old computer with XP as a second opinion scanner only without real-time protection enabled and for a firewall.  Not sure if it's compatible with windows 7, but is meant for older systems like 98, 2000 and XP\n\nComments on the torrent are welcome, but opinions about the software in general are not. i didn't make the software and if you don't like it, I don't care! It is only meant for people who may find it or some of the components included useful, or those who don't want the new lite version that is available on download sites. thanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bcae5bfa77c75844892ed01e6853fe7138ac9b5","amp;dn":"FortiClient+v.4.2.0.0250","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bcae5bfa77c75844892ed01e6853fe7138ac9b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,202,229,191,167,124,117,132,72,146,237,1,230,133,63,231,19,138,201,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

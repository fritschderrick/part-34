The record has Mobley reaching out into a new bag, hitting a more soulfully arranged sound than on some of his other straighter Blue Notes. Duke Pearson arranged the group, and it's slightly larger than usual -- with James Spaulding on alto, Lee Morgan on trumpet, McCoy Tyner on piano, Reggie Workman on bass, Billy Higgins on drums, and Kiane Zawadi and Howard Johnson providing a very unique tuba/euphonium bass part. Titles include &quot;Hank's Other Bag&quot;, &quot;Touch Of Blue&quot;, and &quot;A Slice Of The Top&quot;. \n\nThe four Mobley originals on this recording were written while Mobley was in prison during the mid sixties. Duke Pearson arranged the songs at Mobley's request and they were recorded upon Mobley's release. Inspired by Miles Davis' &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; band but swinging much harder this modal/hardbop date kicks off with the tuba and euphonium playing the lead-in to &quot;Hank's Other Bag&quot; - Duke Pearson's mastery of arrangment is established within the first few measures of the song. Mobley is in fine form, as are the other all-stars - good songs, good performances, well worth finding. ~ Douglas T Martin\n\nPersonnel:\nJames Spaulding, alto sax\nLee Morgan, trumpet\nMcCoy Tyner, piano\nReggie Workman, bass\nKiane Zawadi, euphonium \nHoward Johnson, tuba\nBilly Higgins, drums\n\nHank Mobley - A Slice Of The Top Tracks:\n01  Hank's Other Bag\n02  There's a Lull in My Life\n03  Cute 'N Pretty\n04  Touch of Blue\n05  Slice of the Top\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4978d4a5d2ab35f85e7576e0d99909364ed5c39b","amp;dn":"Hank+Mobley+-+A+Slice+Of+The+Top+%281966%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bsc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4978d4a5d2ab35f85e7576e0d99909364ed5c39b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,120,212,165,210,171,53,248,94,117,118,224,217,153,9,54,78,213,195,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Every wound is in there somewhere, all the scars there for everyone to see. On The world is saved, Stina's first album on her own label, A walk in the park (the name of a song title from her 1991 debut) the healing is in its full bloom.\n\nAs the title suggests, this is some of the most hopeful music Stina Nordenstam has ever recorded.\n\nStill, she has always felt a strong sense of belonging with - what she calls\n- the misfits.\n- The junkies, the homeless, the addicts and the mentally ill. The human beings society never knows how to deal with and therefore treat as aliens. They are the people that I can relate to, whom I feel empathy with. To me, each one of them is worth ten times more than any Vice President. Two songs on the album (Im staring at the world and The morning belongs to the night) started out as part of a Swedish TV documentary by Adam Nilsson called Jean-Claude about a Parisian who once was both a florist and a celebrated model but lived most of his life on the streets. The Jean-Claudes of this world will forever play an important part in the music, art and life of Stina Nordenstam.\n\nListening to her music, reading her lyrics, we should be thankful that someone, in times as empty, shallow and superficial as ours, dares to be this complicated, this human.\nAnd still without forgetting the importance of beauty. Melodies as precious as Stina's are a rare thing. Treasure them, hold them like your childrens' lives depended on it.\nIf you listen to them carefully you dont have to sleep, we can just sit here and together and watch the sun come up.\n\nby Andres Lokko Stockholm, July 2004\n\n\n- - -\n\nStina Nordenstam - The world is saved 2004\n(Stockholm V2)\n\n 1.

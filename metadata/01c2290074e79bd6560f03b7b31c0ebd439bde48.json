Wilde shows feminist leanings as he attacks the injustice of a society that condemns a &quot;fallen&quot; woman while admiring the cause of her downfall. A Woman of No Importance is a great reminder of how good Oscar Wilde is. He writes beautifully in both comic and (sometimes melo) dramatic mode and his main characters are memorable.\n\n\n\n-------------------File Information---------------------\nBroadcast BBC R7 05 Dec 2010\nFirst broadcast BBC R4\nMPEG 1.0 Layer 3 - 160 kbps mp3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 44 khz - Stereo, CRC\nDuration: 85 Mins\nWebrip\nSource: Re-upload of SeymourDAC dead seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01c2290074e79bd6560f03b7b31c0ebd439bde48","amp;dn":"A+Woman+of+No+Importance+-+Oscar+Wilde++%28BBC+2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01c2290074e79bd6560f03b7b31c0ebd439bde48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,194,41,0,116,231,155,214,86,15,3,183,179,28,14,189,67,155,222,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

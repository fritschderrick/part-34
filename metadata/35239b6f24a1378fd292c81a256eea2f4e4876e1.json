Carman and Hal M. Saunders (thank you for your hard work - publishers just need to provide Ebook downloads for these books so we don't have to pirate them)\nISBN: 978-0-13-232102-0 / 9780132321020 / 0-13-232102-5 / 0132321025\n\nI tore apart my textbook and scanned it, so you don't have to carry that fat book around in your backpack as well as your laptop. Just carry your laptop with this PDF. Simple as that! Save some trees.\n\nThis is the fourth textbook I've scanned, so my methods are getting &quot;a bit&quot; better (read: pristine quality with page bookmarks). Pretty much original quality at this point. Enjoy.\n\nPROTIP: Use &quot;two page&quot; reading mode, with &quot;cover&quot; enabled. That way the pages show up in order with page numbers on the outer edges.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35239b6f24a1378fd292c81a256eea2f4e4876e1","amp;dn":"Mathematics+for+the+Trades%2C+8e%2C+ISBN+978-0-13-232102-0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35239b6f24a1378fd292c81a256eea2f4e4876e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,35,155,111,36,161,55,143,210,146,200,26,37,110,234,47,78,72,118,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

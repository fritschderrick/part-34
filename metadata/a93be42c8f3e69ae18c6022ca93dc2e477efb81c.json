It packs a few configuration settings that can be handled by users of any level of experience.\nUnlike other similar apps which return the old Start menu and button, the side menu of StartIsBack is transparent and highlights every new program in the list.\nWhen it comes to functionality, StartIsBack integrates some useful features. For example, if you search the computer for a new item, this is instantly shown in the results area (if it was previously indexed by Windows).\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n-New unique &quot;Show everything at once&quot; function which you will instantly love - just hold Windows key on your keyboard (or double-tap Windows logo on your tablet) and access charms, search, your started apps in Desktop and Modern interfaces at the same time, in any app you're using.\nYou don't have to run your mouse pointer to the screen corners or perform awkward swipes anymore!\n\n-Easier, broader Start menu configuration\n-Full integration with Windows 8.1 start button\n-Get shortcuts for Modern apps on your desktop\n-Uninstall Modern apps from Start menu\n-Improved multi-monitor support\n\n\nWhat's new in Version 1.0.5 (November 8th, 2013) :\n-Default start button selection covers whole taskbar edge\n-StartIsBack DLLs are now digitally signed too\n-Fixed: running search items with parameters didn't work\n-Fixed: minor issues with right-button-drag on start menu items\n-Fixed: userpic could display wrong on domain-joined machines\n\n\nOperating System :\nWindows 8.1 is Required.\n\nNote: For Windows 8, Use StartIsBack 2.1.2 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a93be42c8f3e69ae18c6022ca93dc2e477efb81c","amp;dn":"StartIsBackPlus+for+Windows+8.1+1.0.5+Final+%2B+Key","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a93be42c8f3e69ae18c6022ca93dc2e477efb81c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,59,228,44,143,62,105,174,24,198,2,44,169,61,194,228,119,239,184,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

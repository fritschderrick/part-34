Nearly 1,000 diagrams that certainly makes it easier We've striven throughout to make sure that the moves and the diagrams they relate in are on the same page-spread.\nLook for blue diagrams and blue boxes that call your attention to the most important positions and ideas. This highlighted information will be especially worth revisiting and even committing to roemory.\nMain lines are clearly set off in hold type. Divisions ofl these main lines are clearly labelled in blue type Diagrams related to main lines are larger than analysis and side-line diagrams, which are clearly labelled &quot;ANALYSIS' The never-before-published surprise moves, &quot;TNs&quot; are also marked in blue You can find many such theoretical novelties throughout,\nPirc Alert! uses the now universal algebraic system of chcss notation. &quot;\n\nAbout the Authors\nInternational Grandmaster Lev Alburt, three-time U.S. champion and former European champion, is one of the most sought-after chess teachers in the world. He lives in New York.\nWorld-championship candidate Grandmaster Alex Chernin lives in Budapest and is the leading expert on the Pirc.\n\nNOTE\nThe original book was in DJVU format &amp; I have converted it to PDF. I am not very happy about the scan quality but unfortunately I don't have anything better! OCRing of the converted PDF was almost impossible due to low scan quality.\nThe 2nd Revised &amp; Updated edition was published in September 2009 but I don't have it yet.

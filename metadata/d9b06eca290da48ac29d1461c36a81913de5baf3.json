A proposed album of love songs \nwas in the works around 1995 when the Bee Gees recorded old hits \nlike &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and &quot;Emotion&quot; from the late '60s, but that project was \nsoon shelved and those recordings remained unavailable until 2001.\n\nFollowing the success of the Number Ones compilation in 2004, Universal once \nagain tried to mine the Bee Gees catalog, this time focusing on their ballads. \nSpanning their entire career, Love Songs features many of the group's big hits, \nbut also includes some lesser known tracks such as &quot;Secret Love&quot; and &quot;For Whom \nThe Bell Tolls&quot;, which were both big hits in Europe. Also, included is the live \nversion of &quot;Islands In The Stream&quot;, which many consider the superior Bee Gees \nversion as compared with the techo-version found on 2001's Their Greatest Hits: \nThe Record.\n\nThe U.S. and the UK versions differed slightly in song selection and running time. \nIncluded in the UK version were 1993's &quot;Heart Like Mine&quot; and a song the Gibb Brothers \nwrote for Ronan Keating in 1999 called &quot;Lovers And Friends&quot; in which The Bee Gees sing \nbackup. This irked many fans as this was not a true Bee Gees song in that it prevented \nother classic Bee Gees tracks from making the album. Another anomaly was the inclusion \nof the Robin Gibb solo hit &quot;Juliet&quot; from 1983, which was a big hit in many countries, \nexcept in the UK and the U.S.\n\nBy the time &quot;Love Songs&quot; was released, there had been several Bee Gees compilations on \nthe market as well as their entire back catalog, so this release seemed somewhat redundant. \nIn the U.S. it did chart but only managed to reach #166. In the UK it climbed to #51, but its \nbest showing was in France where it went Top 20, peaking at.\n\n\nTrack listings:\n\n\n1.To Love Somebody\n2.Words\n3.First of May\n4.Lonely Days\n5.How Can You Mend Broken Heart?\n6.How Deep Is Your Love?\n7.More Than a Woman\n8.(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away\n9.Emotion\n10.Too Much Heaven\n11.Heartbreaker\n12.Islands in the Stream\n13.Juliet\n14.Secret Love\n15.For Whom the Bell Tolls\n16.Closer Than Close\n17.I Could Not Love You More\n18.Wedding Day\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9b06eca290da48ac29d1461c36a81913de5baf3","amp;dn":"Bee+Gees+-+Love+Songs+2005+%5BMp3%5D%5B320kbs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9b06eca290da48ac29d1461c36a81913de5baf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,176,110,202,41,13,164,138,194,157,20,97,195,106,129,145,61,229,186,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

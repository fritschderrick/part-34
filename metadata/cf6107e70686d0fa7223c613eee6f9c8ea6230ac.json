This, their third LP, relies heavily on soul covers, as well as a few oft-covered blues standards (&quot;Midnight Special,&quot; &quot;Mean Woman Blues,&quot; &quot;Dust My Blues&quot;). Highlights are their second British number one hit &quot;Somebody Help Me,&quot; the decent group original &quot;High Time Baby,&quot; Winwood's organ-based instrumental &quot;On the Green Light,&quot; and &quot;When I Get Home,&quot; which (like &quot;Somebody Help Me&quot;) was a hit in Britain, but not the U.S. \n\nRelease Date\n 1966\n\nGenre\nPop/Rock\nR&amp;B\n\n\nStyles\nBritish Invasion\nBlue-Eyed Soul\nSoul\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf6107e70686d0fa7223c613eee6f9c8ea6230ac","amp;dn":"Spencer+Davis+Group%2C+The+++%26lrm%3B%26ndash%3B+Autumn+%2766+%5Bvinyl+24-192","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf6107e70686d0fa7223c613eee6f9c8ea6230ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,97,7,231,6,134,208,250,114,35,198,19,238,230,249,200,234,98,48,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Most were released on Sub Pop but there are some on some volumes that came out on other labels.\nIf you like the Sub Pop compilations, you'll like these.\nSorry that there are a few songs that aren't perfect sound quality - some were recorded of the radio years ago.\nThere are 7 compilations in this series, none of which were released. They're all my doing in terms of compiling.\nTherefore, I would appreciate some thanks for what I do.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca3f0a93ea9edf04a5141056d568d5b528f1da84","amp;dn":"Grunge+is+Back+vol.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca3f0a93ea9edf04a5141056d568d5b528f1da84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,63,10,147,234,158,223,4,165,20,16,86,213,104,213,181,40,241,218,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

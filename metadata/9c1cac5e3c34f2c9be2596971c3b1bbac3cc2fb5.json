Occultus Mundorum is split in two parts; part one consists of all the base files and part two adds the new music and ambient sounds. The mod is fully compatible with version 1.7.x and all the DLC's. It does also fully function in multiplayer, as it is built for it. \nThe mod is still being worked on! \n\nFeatures: \n- Early canals (adm tech 12) \n- More great works \n- New casus-belli's \n- Redone UI \n- 3 New mythical continents \n- Improved map graphics \n- New formable countries \n- New music ( part II ) \n- New ambient sounds ( part II ) \n- More ideas \n- New religions \n- Added flavour events \n- More provinces \n- More trade goods \n- More buildings \n\nComing features: \n- New elven / treemen continent \n- Magic. \n\nCompatibility: \nThis mod is incompatible with almost everything, because it changes most files, I would advise testing it out yourself if you feel the mod you are thinking of should be compatible. \n\nKnown bugs: \nGraphical black stuff, some localisation missing. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c1cac5e3c34f2c9be2596971c3b1bbac3cc2fb5","amp;dn":"Occultus+Mundorum+-+Europa+Universalis+IV+mod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c1cac5e3c34f2c9be2596971c3b1bbac3cc2fb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,28,172,94,60,52,242,201,190,37,150,151,28,59,27,186,195,204,47,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

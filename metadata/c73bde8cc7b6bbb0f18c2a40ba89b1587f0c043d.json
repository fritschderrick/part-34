During the early '80s, however, several other Canadian metal acts attempted to break out globally -- but with a sound that reflected the party-hearty style of Van Halen. Tops on this list would be Helix. Although they started out in the late '70s, it wasn't until the early to mid-'80s that they enjoyed some moderate MTV play, and also landed some prime opening spots on the touring circuit (Kiss, Whitesnake, etc.). And this is exactly the group's &quot;peak era&quot; that the 1989 21-track compilation Over 60 Minutes With... focuses on. The most memorable tracks remain the ones whose videos made the rounds back in the day -- the self-explanatory anthem &quot;Heavy Metal Love,&quot; &quot;Rock You&quot; (which didn't contain exactly the most sophisticated rock lyrics penned...but never mind), and also the power ballad &quot;Deep Cuts the Knife.&quot; And for fans who already own this material, there are three previously unreleased tracks as well -- &quot;Give It to You,&quot; &quot;Jaws of the Tiger,&quot; and &quot;Everybody Pays the Price.&quot; Over 60 Minutes With... is all the Helix most headbangers will require.\n\n\n1.

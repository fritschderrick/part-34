This course shows how to use WinRT, in conjunction with XAML, to build Metro applications for Windows 8.\n\nWith Windows 8 a new application model called Metro was introduced, along with a new runtime called WinRT (Windows RunTime.) In this course you'll learn the fundamentals of developing Metro apps in C++ using language extensions called C++/CX, XAML, and the WinRT libraries. Leverage the C++ skills you already have and develop Metro apps for Windows 8 with the same libraries as C# or Javascript programmers.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/courses/tableofcontents?courseName=win8-cpp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/courses/tableofcontents?courseName=win8-cpp&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb4609e2a98b1b9ae26dc3496264cac4b252ec57","amp;dn":"Building+Windows+8+Metro+Apps+with+C%23+%26amp%3B+C%2B%2B+and+XAML","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb4609e2a98b1b9ae26dc3496264cac4b252ec57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,70,9,226,169,139,27,154,226,109,195,73,98,100,202,196,178,82,236,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

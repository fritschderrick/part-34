Each technology is described in depth, with a discussion of key concepts, historical development, and industry standards. The book contains comprehensive coverage of all broadband access technologies, with a section each devoted to fiber-based technologies, non-fiber wired technologies, and wireless technologies. The four co-authorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ breadth of knowledge is featured in the chapters comparing the relative strengths, weaknesses, and prognosis for the competing technologies.\n\nKey Features:\n\nCovers the physical and medium access layers (OSI Layer 1 and 2), with emphasis on access transmission technology\nCompares and contrasts all recent and emerging wired and wireless standards for broadband access in a single reference\nIllustrates the technology that is currently being deployed by network providers, and also the technology that has recently been or will soon be standardized for deployment in the coming years, including vectoring, wavelength division multiple access, CDMA, OFDMA, and MIMO\nContains detailed discussion on the following standards: 10G-EPON, G-PON, XG-PON, VDSL2, DOCSIS 3.0, DOCSIS Protocol over EPON, power line carrier, IEEE 802.11 WLAN/WiFi, UMTS/HSPA, LTE, and LTE-Advanced\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://e-books-pdf.com/uploads/posts/2014-05/thumbs/1400548031_5251.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://e-books-pdf.com/uploads/posts/2014-05/thumbs/1400548031_5251.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55a8616743c00572cf158f61349ac333f54db29d","amp;dn":"Broadband+Access%3A+Wireline+and+Wireless+prabhu_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55a8616743c00572cf158f61349ac333f54db29d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,168,97,103,67,192,5,114,207,21,143,97,52,154,195,51,245,77,178,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

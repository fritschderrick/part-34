Blocks start on the \n\nedges of the screen, and fall towards the inner blue hexagon. The objective of the \n\ngame is to prevent the blocks from stacking outside the area of the grey hexagon. \n\nTo do this, you must rotate the hexagon to collect different stacks of blocks on \n\neach face. Aim to connect 3 or more blocks of the same color. When they match up, \n\nthose 3 blocks are destroyed, and the blocks above them slide down. Destroying \n\nmultiple series of blocks grants combos, whose durations are indicated by a \n\nquickly receding outline around the outer hexagon. You lose once a stack forms \n\noutside the outer boundary!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42504d754baeec80fc228638764a43f53045c89b","amp;dn":"Hexa+Tetris+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42504d754baeec80fc228638764a43f53045c89b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,80,77,117,75,174,236,128,252,34,134,56,118,74,67,245,48,69,200,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

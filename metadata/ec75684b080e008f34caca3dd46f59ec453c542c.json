One spring morning, \nthe amateur guitarist played his hard-rock version of Johann Pachelbel's \nclassic Canon in D in front of his webcam and uploaded it onto the Internet. \nHis musical sense and his exceptional skills with the instrument attracted a \ngreat deal of attention, generating a hit rate exceeding 10 million on Youtube \nand making himself an Internet sensation. Guitar fans and musicians the \nworld over expressed admiration for him, many imitated him, and some even \nwanted to challenge him.\n\nNow, JerryC's highly anticipated debut EP is finally released. It comes with his \nbreakout hit Canon Rock and his latest work Dear Mozart, plus their guitar-\nless versions, as well as the guitar tabs for Canon Rock.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec75684b080e008f34caca3dd46f59ec453c542c","amp;dn":"JerryC+-+Canon+Rock+%282009%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec75684b080e008f34caca3dd46f59ec453c542c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,117,104,75,8,14,0,143,52,202,202,61,212,111,89,236,69,60,84,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Kingseed\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nOn the hellish battlefields of World War II Europe, Major Dick Winters led his Easy CompanyÃ¢â‚¬â€the now-legendary Band of BrothersÃ¢â‚¬â€from the confusion and chaos of the D-Day invasion to the final capture of HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s EagleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nest.\n\nBut WintersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story didn't end there. It was only the beginning. \n\nHe was a quiet, reluctant hero whose modesty and strength drew the admiration of not only his men, but millions worldwide. Now comes the story of Dick Winters in his last years as witnessed and experienced by his good friend, Cole C. Kingseed.\n\nKingseed shares the formative experiences that made Winters such an effective leader. He addresses WintersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experiences and leadership during the war, his intense, unbreakable devotion to his men, his search for peace both without and within after the war, and how fame forced him to make adjustments to an international audience of well-wishers and admirers, even as he attempted to leave a lasting legacy before joining his fallen comrades. Following WintersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death on January 2, 2011, the outpouring of grief and adulation for one of this nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preeminent leaders of character, courage, and competence shows just how much of an impact Dick Winters left on the world.\n\nThis is a story of leadership, fame, and friendship, and the journey of one manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s struggle to find the peace that he promised himself if he survived World War II.\n\n\nBook Cover: https://img.bi/#/iPHhnKj!fNeIZgzKRTwge1MD6QvawMwwjhCUqQwTey2gaZ0h","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dd3ae4de370cfe4d8776317fe1c92fa5f42792b","amp;dn":"Conversations+with+Major+Dick+Winters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dd3ae4de370cfe4d8776317fe1c92fa5f42792b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,211,174,77,227,112,207,228,216,119,99,23,254,28,146,250,95,66,121,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

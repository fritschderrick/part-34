Sir David Attenborough narrates.\r\n\r\nEpisode 4 of 7: Hunger at Sea (Oceans)\r\n\r\nHunger at Sea follows blue whales, sharks, sea lions, frigatebirds, dolphins and albatrosses to reveal the strategies they use to hunt for prey in the big blue. The open ocean is an immense wilderness that covers more than half the surface of our planet, yet for the most part it's a watery desert, largely devoid of life. Predators face an endless search to find and catch food, yet these great tracts of ocean are home to some of the most remarkable hunters on the planet.\r\n\r\n=====================================================================================\r\nSource.......: HDTV\r\nSize.........: 322MB\r\nFormat.......: mp4\r\nResolution...: 640x360\r\nVideo........: h.264, 700Kbps @ 25 fps\r\nAudio........: aac, 93Kbps, 48 KHz, 2 channels\r\n=====================================================================================\r\n\r\nghost dog","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ac55d15afdc8a3d1570cf1dec86a5d403b16e34","amp;dn":"The+Hunt+S01E04+-+Hunger+at+Sea+%28Oceans%29+HDTV+x264+-+GHOST+DOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ac55d15afdc8a3d1570cf1dec86a5d403b16e34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,197,93,21,175,220,138,61,21,112,207,29,236,134,165,212,3,177,110,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It was originally released in April 2003 in UK.\n\nThe documentary was produced largely by the same team who produced the award-winning documentary series Walking with Dinosaurs and Walking with Beasts, though the original series&amp;#039; director, Tim Haines was not involved. In the previous documentaries, extinct animals were recreated with CGI and animatronics. For Walking with Cavemen, a slightly different approach was taken. While most of the animals depicted were still computer generated or animatronic, the human ancestors were portrayed by actors wearing makeup and prosthetics, giving them a more realistic look and permitting the actors to give the creatures a human quality.\n\nLike its predecessors, Walking with Cavemen is made in the style of a wildlife documentary, featuring a voice-over narrator who describes the recreations of the prehistoric past as if they are real. As with the predecessors, this approach necessitated the presentation of speculation as if it is fact, and some of the statements made about the behaviour of the creatures are more open to question than the documentary may indicate.\n\nEach species segment takes the form of a short drama featuring a group of the particular hominid in question going about their daily lives (the search for food, protecting territory, and caring for the sick and injured). The intent is to get the human viewer to feel for the creatures being examined, almost to imagine being one of them (a trait that the documentary links to the modern human brain).\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_with_Cavemen\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Author/Presenter - Robert Winston\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nProfessor Lord Robert Winston was born in 1940 and named Robert Maurice \nWinston. He graduated at London University in 1964 and held junior posts at \nthe London Hospital from that time. In 1970 he joined the Hammersmith Hospital \nas a Registrar and became involved in research and development in \ngynaecological microsurgery. \n\nHe is well known today to audiences throughout the world for his several BBC \ntelevision series, which include The Human Body, Secret Life of Twins and \nSuperhuman, and through which he has shown a great capacity for communicating \noften complex science to a wide public audience. He is Professor of Fertility \nStudies at Imperial College School of Medicine, London University, and is \nworld-renowned as a fertility expert. He also heads the Department of Reproductive Medicine at the Hammersmith Hospital in London.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Walking with Cavemen - Episode 4: The Survivors\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNearly half a million years ago, the most advanced human yet roams Europe. Strong and powerful, Homo heidelbergensis are fierce hunters, use sophisticated tools and live in close-knit family groups. They look and behave in a very human way - yet something is missing. In &amp;#039;The Survivors&amp;#039;, the final programme in the series, we follow three brothers on a hunt. When one brother is injured his distraught family spends most of the night trying to keep him alive. Yet in the morning, the hunter is dead and his family has gone, leaving him where he died. There is no ceremony and no looking back. Heidelbergensis can only see the world as it is. They cannot, for example, think of a life after death, for they lack the one thing that makes us human - a modern imagination.\n\nHeidelbergensis are the departure point for the last leg of the journey towards modern humans. Over 200,000 years they become split into two populations by extremes of weather and environment and evolve separately into two very different species. In the North are the Neanderthals, whose physical power and resilience is the key to surviving in ice age Northern Europe. In their world, being strong and tough is the key to survival. If the going gets tough, they just fight back harder.\n\nIn the South the other descendants of heidelbergensis, are finding the going even harder. About 140,000 years ago, Africa is in the grip of a devastating drought, and something remarkable has happened to the descendants of heidelbergensis who live there. The combination of environment and chance has bred in them a unique ability that will change the course of human history.\n\nThey have developed a mind capable of imagination. For the first time on Earth there is a creature capable of understanding and anticipating possibilities, with the gift of abstract thought. It very possibly saves them from the brink of extinction. Although the Neanderthals were unbeatable for a quarter of a million years, it will be this small band of southern survivors, perhaps numbering just a few tens of thousands, who will come to dominate the world and be known as Homo sapiens.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOther torrents related to my favorite subject; humans and human behaviour:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/3bord3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/3bord3/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7f1289c9802ab86ec63c674f3bf6247bd5374cc","amp;dn":"BBC+Walking+With+Cavemen+4+of+4+Robert+Winston","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7f1289c9802ab86ec63c674f3bf6247bd5374cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,241,40,156,152,2,171,134,236,99,198,116,243,191,98,71,189,83,116,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

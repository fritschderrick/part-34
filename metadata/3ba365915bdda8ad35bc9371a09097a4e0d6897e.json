Twenty-two years later, she returns to ask the present owner, Peter Carrington, if she can use the mansion for a fund-raiser. The two fall madly in love, and after a whirlwind courtship, they marry despite the shadow of suspicion that hangs over Peter regarding the death of a neighbor's daughter two decades earlier and the drowning of his first wife four years before. After an idyllic honeymoon, the couple return to New Jersey, where a magazine article has caused the police to reopen the cases. The subsequent discovery of two bodies buried on the estate causes even Kay to doubt her husband's innocence. Clark (Two Little Girls in Blue) deftly keeps the finger of guilt pointed in many directions until the surprising conclusion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ba365915bdda8ad35bc9371a09097a4e0d6897e","amp;dn":"Mary+H+Clark+-+I+Heard+That+Song+Before","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ba365915bdda8ad35bc9371a09097a4e0d6897e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,163,101,145,91,221,168,173,53,188,147,113,160,144,151,164,224,214,137,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

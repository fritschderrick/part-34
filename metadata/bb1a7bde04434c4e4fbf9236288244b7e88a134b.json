Given the limitations of such a small setup, it takes quite a bit of imagination and sound variation to keep things interesting. On &quot;Circle of the Crayfish&quot;, they do manage to get some outlandish sounds out of the organ, and combined with the riproaring tempos, the group do keep things hopping for the most part. There's even an introspective electronic piece. Even with all of the innovations applied, the album still sounds too monolithic for its own good.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Ballast\n2. Kolibri\n3. Becoming Older\n4. Journey\n5. Paradise Lost\n6. Crayfish\n\nMembers:\nArmin Stoewe - organ, piano, synthesizer, guitar, vocal\nRoland Schupp - drums, percussion &amp; gongs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb1a7bde04434c4e4fbf9236288244b7e88a134b","amp;dn":"Sixty+Nine+-+Circle+Of+The+Crayfish+%281972%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb1a7bde04434c4e4fbf9236288244b7e88a134b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,26,123,222,4,67,76,78,79,191,146,54,40,130,68,183,232,138,19,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Philadelphia lawyer Campbell Smith seems to have it all. But in Bonnie MacDougal's powerful new novel of suspense, beneath the thin surface of tranquillity and realized dreams, dark events threaten to throw Cam Smith's neatly arranged life profoundly--and perilously--Out of Order.\n\nOn the night of a lavish party celebrating newlyweds Doug and Campbell Smith, tragedy strikes when the thirteen-year-old son of an influential senator is kidnapped. The senator--Doug's mentor--urges Cam to track the boy down. It is an offer she cannot refuse, despite her own unsettling suspicion that the statesman seems less concerned about his child than about keeping the scandal out of the headlines. But as Cam soon discovers, everyone has something to hide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4660dfa2c5e9ae60bd4c855a1190c2f3be108c50","amp;dn":"Bonnie+MacDougal-+Out+Of+Order","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4660dfa2c5e9ae60bd4c855a1190c2f3be108c50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,96,223,162,197,233,174,96,189,76,133,90,17,144,194,243,190,16,140,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

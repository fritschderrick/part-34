An attempt by the team to\n\nstop him at the Kremlin ends in a disaster, with an explosion causing severe destruction to the Kremlin and the IMF being implicated in the bombing, forcing the\n\nPresident to invoke Ghost Protocol, under which the IMF is disavowed, and will be offered no help or backup in any form. Undaunted, Ethan and his team chase Hendricks\n\nto Dubai, and from there to Mumbai, but several spectacular action sequences later, they might still be too late to stop a disaster.\n\n:::Cast:::\n\nTom Cruise ...

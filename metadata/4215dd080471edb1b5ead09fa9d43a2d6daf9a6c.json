It was written by Rachel Pollack and illustrated by Chris Weston.\nTime Breakers narrates the exploits of a self-recruited team of time travellers dedicated to the creation of time paradoxes in the belief that this is the only method to prevent the destruction of time itself. Contrary to the performance of most other Helix titles, Time Breakers gained a loyal readership yet the overall poor sales figures of the Helix line dissuaded DC from renewing the title for an additional series","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4215dd080471edb1b5ead09fa9d43a2d6daf9a6c","amp;dn":"Time+Breakers+%23+1-5+%28Helix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4215dd080471edb1b5ead09fa9d43a2d6daf9a6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,21,221,8,4,113,237,177,181,234,208,159,169,212,58,45,109,175,154,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

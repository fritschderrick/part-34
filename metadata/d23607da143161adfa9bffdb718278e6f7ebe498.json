It's a very handy software library written in C++ to reduce the software development process, helping you to kick-start creative coding. With the help of C++ and shaders support, openFrameworks allows for the processing of all kinds of media information with your custom-developed algorithms at the lowest possible level, with the fastest speed.\n\n&quot;Mastering openFrameworks: Creative Coding Demystified&quot; will introduce you to a world of creative coding projects, including interactive installations, audio-visual, and sound art projects. You will learn how to make your own projects using openFrameworks. This book focuses on low-level data processing, which allows you to create really unique and cutting-edge installations and projects.\n\n&quot;Mastering openFrameworks: Creative Coding Demystified&quot; provides a complete introduction to openFrameworks, including installation, core capabilities, and addons. Advanced topics like shaders, computer vision, and depth cameras are also covered.\n\nWe start off by discussing the basic topics such as image and video loading, rendering and processing, playing sound samples, and synthesizing new sounds. We then move on to cover 3D graphics, computer vision, and depth cameras. You will also learn a number of advanced topics such as video mapping, interactive floors and walls, video morphing, networking, and using geometry shaders.\n\nYou will learn everything you need to know in order to create your own projects; create projects of all levels, ranging from simple creative-code experiments, to big interactive systems consisting of a number of computers, depth cameras, and projectors.\nApproach\n\nStuffed with practical examples, this book gives clear and effective instructions to build your own fun, stunning, and highly-interactive openFrameworks applications. Each chapter is focused on one topic and has a new theme to it.\nWho this book is for\n\nIf you are a visual artist, designer, or programmer interested in creative coding with openFrameworks then this book is for you. Basic knowledge of object-oriented programming, such as C++, Java, Python, and ActionScript 3, would be helpful.\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia\n\nRequest textbooks here:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d23607da143161adfa9bffdb718278e6f7ebe498","amp;dn":"Mastering+openFrameworks+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d23607da143161adfa9bffdb718278e6f7ebe498","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,54,7,218,20,49,97,173,250,155,255,219,113,130,120,230,247,235,228,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

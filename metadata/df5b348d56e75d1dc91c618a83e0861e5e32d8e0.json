The song was written by The Veronicas along with Josh Alexander and Billy Steinberg.\n\nThe shooting for the music video took place in Los Angeles, produced by film director James Cox. There are two versions of the video, one censored, and the other uncut (also known as the explicit version). The censored video was released on the official website on August 18. The uncut version was released later on. The video was popular in Europe and was retired on Poland's TRL after spending 50 days on the countdown. The video had much airplay on U.S. television, but was actually played more on Spanish speaking networks than others.\n\nThe uncensored version of the music video starts off with Lena and Yulia pulling up in a car, with the chorus to &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; playing on the radio. The two go into a Korean restaurant as fake headlines are shown on the screen - rumors of their relationship. They sit at a table, take shots and begin arguing to each other, and Yulia storms off. The headlines continue as Yulia walks down the side of the restaurant, and Lena drives off after her. While walking down the road, Yulia gets picked up by a man (played by actor Charlie Koznik). Lena attempts to call Yulia via cell phone, but it seems she is already on her phone with another person. Yulia and the man eventually get to his home, where they start to get intimate. However, it quickly turns into attempted rape, as the man begins to force Yulia into it. Yulia breaks free, flips the man off and calls Lena. However, the man begins to physically assault Yulia, pushing her through the glass top of a coffee table. Her phone is dropped, and Lena drives off in search of her. Yulia is able to break free, with enough time to locate bullets and a gun in a case. When he turns around to attack Yulia again, she shoots him in the head, causing brains to be splattered on the wall. She then climbs out a window and down the fire escape, just in time to meet up with Lena.\n\nThe censored version of the music video has been heavily edited for viewing on television. Omitted are Yulia flipping off the man, her being thrown into the glass, the finding of the gun, and the blood splatter.\n\nDangerous and Moving is the second English-language album by t.A.T.u.

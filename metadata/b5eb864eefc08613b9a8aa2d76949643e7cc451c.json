It specialises in the international football scene. Its regular contributing writers include Brian Glanville, Sid Lowe and Tim Vickery. World Soccer is a member of the European Sports Magazines (ESM), an umbrella group of similar magazines printed in other languages. Other members include A Bola, Don BalÃƒÂ³n, Kicker, La Gazzetta dello Sport and Sport Express. The members of this group elect a European &quot;Team of the Month&quot;, and a European &quot;Team of the Year&quot;.\n\nSince 1982 World Soccer has also organised &quot;Player of the Year&quot;, &quot;Manager of the Year&quot;, and &quot;Team of the Year&quot; awards. In 2005 awards for the best &quot;Young Player of the Year&quot; and &quot;Referee of the Year&quot; were also introduced. In the December 1999 issue of World Soccer, a readers' poll listing the 100 greatest football players of the 20th century was published.\n\nThe magazine marked its 50th anniversary in 2010 with a series of articles looking back on the past 50 years in international soccer.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5eb864eefc08613b9a8aa2d76949643e7cc451c","amp;dn":"World+Soccer+-+One+shot+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5eb864eefc08613b9a8aa2d76949643e7cc451c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,235,134,78,239,192,134,19,185,168,170,45,118,148,150,67,231,204,69,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

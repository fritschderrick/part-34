Ant was always better at image than music, whether he was mixing Native American and pirate gear or employing African-style drumming more for the look than the sound back in the Antmusic days. Since then, he hasn't had any musical compass, although he posed as a dance music frontman on 1990's Manners &amp; Physique. Here he borrowed Madonna's photographer, Anton Corbijn, and her basic theme -- sex-as-amusement/nourishment/salvation. He succeeded in sounding horny, but that didn't make him seductive.

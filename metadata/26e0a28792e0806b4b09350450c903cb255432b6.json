W. Bullinger. \n\nThis is the unltimate study bible. its in pdf form, so you need a PDF reader. there are a a few free ones, and which one is better then the other im not sure, so you have to look around and try a few. I myself use Sumatra PDF, its free, but its not the best out there. \n\n\n More about The Companion Bible by E W Bullinger. \n\nThis bible outlines the , subjust of what your reading, also the 198 Appendixes offer a valuable insight into a lot of topics in the bible, even those things most so called bible teachers will not tell you about  or teach you.\n\nBullinger is not perfect, for example he things in his opinion that Christ was naild to a actual tree and not a cross. Not everyone is perfect. But His work is top notch, you dont get better then Bullinger in my opnion, when it comes to his scholarly notes. \n\nyou will find this useful. to say the least.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26e0a28792e0806b4b09350450c903cb255432b6","amp;dn":"The+Companion+Bible+Full+scan.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26e0a28792e0806b4b09350450c903cb255432b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,224,162,135,146,224,128,107,75,9,53,4,80,201,3,203,37,84,50,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

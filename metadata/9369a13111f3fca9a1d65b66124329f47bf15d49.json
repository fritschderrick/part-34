To      \n   gaze back at the receding blue gem that is our home planet and go     \n     where no human has gone before? What strange sights await you?      \n        What dangers must you avoid? With five decades of space          \n   exploration behind us, we can now begin to answer these questions.     \n     Blast-off with this Australian-made documentary series, which       \n   explores the pleasures and pitfalls of travel to the alien planets     \n   of our own solar system. Narrated by Richard Roxburgh, this series     \n    visits the planets from a very personal perspective: that of the     \n    people who have sent probes hurtling to strange worlds, and also     \n    from the viewpoint of any one of us who might dream of making a      \n     trip ourselves. The series is styled in the guise of a visual       \n       guidebook, tapping into the mystery and intrigue of space         \n     exploration while providing the sort of practical information       \n   required by anyone who might like to imagine actually going there.     \n   Think of it as a kind of handbook for our cosmic neighbourhood. It     \n    recaptures the sense of wonder and romance that was so palpable      \n     during the early years of the exploration of the moon and the       \n     planets beyond. With a renewed push to propel humans into the       \n     heavens and the last three decades of unmanned interplanetary       \n   missions behind us, we now have the legitimacy to look deeply into     \n   the solar system to explore what our planetary neighbours offer in     \n   terms of destinations for human exploration and discovery. As dawn     \n   breaks on a new age of manned space flight, this program offers a     \n        ringside seat to the splendours of the solar system: an          \n         astronaut's guide to whole new worlds of possibility.           \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                \n             \n                                                                           \n                                                                          \n                                                                          \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                            \n                                                                    \n                                             \n                                              \n                                                      \n                                                         \n                                    \n                                                        \n                                                                            \n                \n                                                                  \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                Enjoy!!                                  \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                        \n                                                                      \n                                                                        \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                  \n                \n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n                                                                          \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n                                                                         \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n                                                                            \n                                                                           \n                                                     \n                                      \n                                              \n                                                     \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                             \n                                                                         \n                \n                                                                   \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n                                                                       \n           Shell &amp;

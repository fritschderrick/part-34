No, it's not perfect, but it's heaps better than most of the books on weight training. This focuses specifically on safety and technique, not on routines or dieting. \n\nThe author is currently putting out a new book with revised directions from this book and all the training/dieting info in one handy package. I can't wait to get it. A bit expensive but I'd rather spend forty bucks on reliable, one-volume info than waste my time and money on countless less helpful books and magazines.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deba2a4f1c1c03740ef87566db77f537ba395c30","amp;dn":"THE+INSIDER%5C%27S+TELL-+ALL+HANDBOOK+ON+WEIGHT-+TRAINING+TECHNIQUE-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deba2a4f1c1c03740ef87566db77f537ba395c30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,186,42,79,28,28,3,116,14,248,117,102,219,119,245,55,186,57,92,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

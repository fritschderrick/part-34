Three years after having his right leg amputated six inches above the knee after being diagnosed with osteosarcoma, Fox set out to cover more than a marathonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s distance each day until he reached the shores of Victoria, British Columbia. Anonymous at the start of his journey, Fox steadily captured the heart of a nation with his Marathon of Hope. However the 21-year old BC native's goal was not fame, but to spread awareness and raise funds for cancer research. After 143 days and two-thirds of the way across Canada, with the eyes of a country watching, FoxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s journey came to an abrupt end when newly discovered tumors took over his body. Two-time NBA MVP, proud Canadian, and first-time filmmaker Steve Nash will share FoxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s incredible story of perseverance and hope.\n\nVideo: 624x352 XVID\nAudio: 192kbps/48kHz AC3\nTotal time: 53:05","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fb11c554fc93f8831a7f0850dc94e516cf1d477","amp;dn":"Into+the+Wind%3A+Terry+Fox+%5BSDTV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fb11c554fc93f8831a7f0850dc94e516cf1d477","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,177,28,85,79,201,63,136,49,167,240,133,13,201,78,81,108,241,212,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

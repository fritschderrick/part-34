Oh that great piece on album so and so. Great but you never play it. Its too long for the audience and such a hustle when you are alone. Same with me.\n\nSo I thought lets list these pieces and see whether I could play them in some quite moments when you have the time to listen to music. Not 3 or 4 minutes but real Rock Symphony`s greater than 7 minutes (Brother in Arms is exactly 7 minutes).\n\nSo I made five 2-hour playlists (A148-152) and now I play these wonderful compositions once in while (nice). If anyone has some suggestions for monumental Rock Projects I missed?. For some good candidates, like Valentyn Suite and Supper's Ready (Genesis), I could not find a proper recording. Please put them on the net if you have one of these.... Enjoy,\n\nPS: I skipped a few good tracks like Bohemian Rhapsody and Stairway to Heaven (too well known).\n\n\nDutch Treat - ^A150 What Love (Experimental Rock)\n\n01 Mike Oldfield - Tubular Bells, Pt. 1\n02 Klaatu - Calling Occupants Of Interplanetary Craft\n03 Collectors - What Love (Suite)\n04 Jethro Tull - Thick As A Brick (Part I)\n05 Iron Butterfly - In A Gadda Da Vida\n06 King Crimson - The Court Of The Crimson King\n07 Tool - The Grudge\n08 Deep Purple - Child In Time\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5d49aca77d7855dd18725b093a451f2cc7e58a9","amp;dn":"VA+Rock+Symphony%60s+-+What+Love+%28Dutch+Treat+%5EA150+VBR+MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5d49aca77d7855dd18725b093a451f2cc7e58a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,212,154,202,119,215,133,93,209,135,37,176,147,164,81,242,204,126,88,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings (1954Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1955). It is the first installment in the The Lord of the Rings film series, and was followed by The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003), based on the second and third volumes of The Lord of the Rings.\n\nSet in Middle-earth, the story tells of the Dark Lord Sauron, who is seeking the One Ring. The Ring has found its way to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood). The fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions who form the Fellowship of the Ring begin their journey to Mount Doom in the land of Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed.\n\nReleased on 10 December 2001, the film was highly acclaimed by critics and fans alike who considered it to be a landmark in filmmaking and an achievement in the fantasy film genre. It has continued to be featured on critics' lists of the greatest fantasy films ever made as of 2013. The film was a massive box office success, earning over $871 million worldwide, and becoming the second highest-grossing film of 2001 in the U.S. and worldwide (behind Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) which made it the fifth highest-grossing film ever at the time.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92918b1b8f2c7905a5ca0c1f13d0e73a33267d4a","amp;dn":"The+Lord+of+the+Rings+The+Fellowship+of+the+Ring+%5B2001%5D+DVD9+PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92918b1b8f2c7905a5ca0c1f13d0e73a33267d4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,145,139,27,143,44,121,5,165,202,12,31,19,208,231,58,51,38,125,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

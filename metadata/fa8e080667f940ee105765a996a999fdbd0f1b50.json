The album is made mostly with synthesizers, many synthesizer parts not being played with keyboards at all. It is notable for being Oldfield's first album without at least one instrumental piece; each track is a more conventional pop song.\n\nThe end track, despite appearing to be a lengthier piece, consists of two shorter songs of no apparent connection combined into one track, with a noticeable pause in between. According to Oldfield, the album was made with the full understanding of his recording company, which at the time was demanding he create more commercial material. After recording Earth Moving Oldfield felt like he wanted to move away from 'computerised music' and rely on real musicians and instruments; this culminated in his next album, Amarok.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.

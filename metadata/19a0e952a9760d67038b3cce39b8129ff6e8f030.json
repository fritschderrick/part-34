As other townspeople including Linda begin to display similar symptoms, Alice volunteers her help at the clinic and discerns the town is suffering from an outbreak of meningitis. Junior enforces a quarantine of the clinic and pacifies the panicked patients attempting to break out, which impresses Linda enough to designate him as a Deputy. With a waning supply of antibiotics, Big Jim and Barbie head to the pharmacy but discover Reverend Coggins had already taken all the medicine, believing it was GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plan for the infected to die. Big Jim retrieves the antibiotics to treat the diseased while Barbie tracks down Julia at the cabin where she had followed leads to uncover documentation of PeterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bankruptcy. When Barbie confesses he was visiting ChesterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mill as an enforcer for Phil and PeterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gambling debts, Julia lashes out at him for lying to her. Meanwhile, Joe and Norrie experiment with their simultaneous seizures while Big Jim finds Angie in the underground shelter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19a0e952a9760d67038b3cce39b8129ff6e8f030","amp;dn":"Under+The+Dome+Episode+4+%28720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19a0e952a9760d67038b3cce39b8129ff6e8f030","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,160,233,82,169,118,13,103,3,139,60,206,57,184,18,159,246,232,240,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It presents a unified treatment of the entire field from centimeter to sub-millimeter wavelengths. Topics covered include instruments, sensitivity considerations, observational methods and interpretations of the data recorded with both single dishes and interferometers. This text is useful to both students and experienced practicing astronomers. Besides making major updates and additions throughout the book, the authors have re-organized a number of chapters to more clearly separate basic theory from rapidly evolving practical aspects.\n\nFurther, problem sets have been added at the end of each chapter.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 534 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; Softcover reprint of hardcover 5th ed. 2009 edition (November 23, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3642098827\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3642098826","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfa049187dc1cb72aa4d5775448b2e904dcc80f1","amp;dn":"Tools+of+Radio+Astronomy+5th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfa049187dc1cb72aa4d5775448b2e904dcc80f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,160,73,24,125,193,203,114,170,77,87,117,68,139,46,144,77,204,128,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

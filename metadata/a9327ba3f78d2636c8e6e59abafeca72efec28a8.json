His single &quot;Something About the Way You Look Tonight&quot;/&quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot; sold over 33 million copies worldwide and is &quot;the best-selling single of all time&quot;. He has received six Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards Ã¢â‚¬â€œ winning two awards for Outstanding Contribution to Music and the first Brits Icon in 2013 for his &quot;lasting impact on British culture&quot;, an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, a Tony Award, a Disney Legend award, and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2004.

In 2008, Billboard ranked him the most successful male solo artist on &quot;The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists&quot; (third overall).\n\nElton John was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, is an inductee into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame, and is a fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. Having been named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1996, John received a knighthood from Elizabeth II for &quot;services to music and charitable services&quot; in 1998.

Since its inception, the foundation has raised over $200 million.

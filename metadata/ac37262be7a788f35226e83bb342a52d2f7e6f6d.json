I like all to listen for themselves!)\n\nSuffice to say, elements of jazz, funk/rock, beguine/tango, ...all done in the combination serious/madcap style , an approach that is common among the progressive European big bands (as Pierre DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸erge New Jungle Orchestra,Carlo Actis Dato Band, pino Minafra, Daniele Sepe,Wilem Breuker Collectif,Edvard Vesala, etc ).\nThe arrangements are always interesting, the dynamic of the grupo is over the moon! A first class band in every way.\n\nMost interesting, the guitar work from both soloistas is NOT derived from FZ clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© in the least manner, but each plays in his own mad jazz -influenced fusion style , a better comparison would be Philip Catherine!\n(I think this is an excellent way to approach the guitar on this cd, as Zappa was one of the few melodic and consistantly interesting &quot;rock&quot; style soloists on guitar, IMO).\nNo imitation here, just innovation.\n\n2 highlights 'solo-wise', first the Herbie Hancock /Keith Jarret -inspired piano solo from Rita on &quot;Blessed Relief&quot;.\n\nThe second , a real treat.\n\nOn &quot;King Kong&quot; (which is not treated as the airy 6/8 performance from&quot;Uncle Meat&quot;, but as a lumbering funk-infused rendition), the solo begins, you cannot decipher what instrument it is!\nNo , not keyboards, not guitar.\nWhat it is is Laurent's unique &quot;Jimi Hendrix meets Sun Ra at Pete Cosey's place&quot; electric VIOLIN!\n\nSugarcane Harris on LSD, Jean Luc Ponty in the crazyloco institution! It really makes this track &quot;fly&quot;!\n\nAnother revelation, the composition &quot;Take your Clothes Off...&quot;, from the &quot;... In It For the Money&quot; recording , which might appear, first glance, to be a throwaway track.\nTo the opposite, the version begins with a jazz guitar solo , the chords over a &quot;faux-bossa&quot; groove, before moving on to cartoon absurdity of the original composition, then a funk vamp and saxofone solo!\nVocal renditions of idiot B** Son,Mr Green Genes and Oh! No! further the humor in musics cause, without going overboard (as FZ sometimes did himself). A little corny these &quot;Le Bocalistas&quot;,but the compositions warrant this type vocal humor fun.\n\nI could talk hours on this recording, but I spare you all!\n\nthe only composition that will never 100 % resonate in me is their fine version of &quot;Blessed Relief&quot;. The FZ version was perfect, and the trumpet solo from Sal Marquez, George Duke's fender piano solo, and FZ's own Wha-wha acustic guitar solo can never be equalled, IMO! Still, this version of Le Bocal VERY enjoyable!\n\nAnother fine contribution to the keeping the flame of Zappamusics alive, and with a fresh(and French!) conception.\n\nThey play the stars outta these compositions really. One MILLION stars reviewed! Not a bad note in the recording. Enjoy!\n\n\n\n1. Oh No! (Instrumental Version)\n2. Take Your Clothes Off When You Dance\n3. King Kong\n4. The Idiot Bastard Son\n5.

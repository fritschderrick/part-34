Despite being physically average in almost every respect, Summer had \nalways attracted the attention of men, Tom included. For Tom, it was love at first sight when she walked into the greeting \ncard company where he worked, she the new administrative assistant. Soon, Tom knew that Summer was the woman with whom he \nwanted to spend the rest of his life. Although Summer did not believe in relationships or boyfriends - in her assertion, \nreal life will always ultimately get in the way - Tom and Summer became more than just friends. Through the trials and \ntribulations of Tom and Summer's so-called relationship, Tom could always count on the advice of his two best friends, \nMcKenzie and Paul. However, it is Tom's adolescent sister, Rachel, who is his voice of reason. After all is said and done, \nTom is the one who ultimately has to make the choice to listen or not.\n\n \nJoseph Gordon-Levitt ... Tom Hansen\nZooey Deschanel ... Summer Finn\nGeoffrey Arend ...

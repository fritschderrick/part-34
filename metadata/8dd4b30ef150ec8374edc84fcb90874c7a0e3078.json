The album topped the charts on its release in 1973, and it remained in the charts for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988. With an estimated 50 million copies sold it is the band's most commercially successful work and is frequently ranked as one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\nSir Tom Stoppard was first approached with the suggestion of writing a play based on the album by a friend in 1973. Now, 40 years later, he's created a fantastical story about fear, philosophy and madness, which is woven together with the original music.\n\nAired on BBC 2 Radio, 26th August 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dd4b30ef150ec8374edc84fcb90874c7a0e3078","amp;dn":"Darkside+-+This+is+not+a+drill.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dd4b30ef150ec8374edc84fcb90874c7a0e3078","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,212,179,14,241,80,236,131,116,237,200,79,203,144,135,76,122,14,48,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

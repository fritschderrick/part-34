We have a collection here of Yu-Gi-Oh! starting with the first series anime, subbed by TV Nihon and including the first series movie, continuing through the American-released anime series (an English dub DVD rip until season 3, after which they are modified TV rips to maintain a consistent aspect ratio) and including the 3 special uncut release DVD rips (in Dual Audio with DVD subs). This DOES NOT include the movie &quot;Pyramid of Light&quot;, but if there is really that much demand for it, I will acquire a copy and v2 this release.\n\nTo clarify fully, these are the best possible quality you can find. Unlike other torrents on this site, every one of the 224 series 2 episodes is English dubbed. Season 0 is Japanese with hardsubs. All 9 uncut episodes are here in dual audio with all subtitle tracks intact.\n\nIf you don't know Yu-Gi-Oh! by now, I really don't feel like explaining it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c3e91812ee91573584631bc0afee53954dffa22","amp;dn":"Yu-Gi-Oh%21+Duel+Monsters+1-224+%28Eng.+Dub%29%2C+Season+0+%28Subbed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c3e91812ee91573584631bc0afee53954dffa22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,62,145,129,46,233,21,115,88,70,49,188,10,254,229,57,84,223,250,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

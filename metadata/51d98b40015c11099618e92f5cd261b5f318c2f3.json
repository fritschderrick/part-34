Written by H.G. Wells (1866-1946), it tells the story of a scientist who discovers the secret of invisibility and uses it on himself. The story begins as the Invisible Man, with a bandaged face and a heavy coat and gloves, takes a train to lodge in a country inn whilst he tries to discover the antidote and make himself visible again. The book inspired several films and is notable for its vivid descriptions of the invisible manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“no mean feat, given that you can't see him!\n\n\n\nAn M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51d98b40015c11099618e92f5cd261b5f318c2f3","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+Audiobook+-+Invisible+Man+by+H.G.+Wells","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51d98b40015c11099618e92f5cd261b5f318c2f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,217,139,64,1,92,17,9,150,24,233,47,92,210,97,181,243,24,194,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Little wonder it was\nsnapped up for the small screen.\n\nPerhaps interest in this production is also heightened thanks to the\npresence of former Downton Abbey star Jessica Brown Findlay\n[Lady Sybil Crawford] as AlaÃƒÂ¯s Pelletier du Mas.\n\nDr Alice Tanner (played by Vanessa Kirby) is a modern-day PhD graduate\nwho inherits a home in the South of France where she is haunted by\ndreams of a woman from the past. Back to medieval times where we follow\nthe life of AlaÃƒÂ¯s Pelletier du Mas, a 17-year-old who lives in\n13th-century Carcassone.\n\nLabyrinth tells the story of these two women, separated by time, but\nunited in a common destiny\n\nVanessa Kirby as Alice Tanner\nJessica Brown Findlay as AlaÃƒÂ¯s Pelletier du Mas\nSebastian Stan as Will\nEmun Elliott as Guilhem du Mas\nTony Curran as Guy d'Ãƒâ€°vreux\nJohn Hurt as Audric Baillard\nKatie McGrath as Oriane Congost\nTom Felton as Viscount Trencavel\nJohn Lynch as Simon de Montfort\nBernhard Schir as Paul Authie\nClaudia Gerini as Marie-Cecile de l'Oradore\nDanny Keogh as Bertrand Pelletier\nJanet Suzman as Esclarmonde\nLena DÃƒÂ¶rrie as Rixende\nIsabella-Rose Tsinonis as Bertrande [Alais' daughter]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/UfbWE.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/UfbWE.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/cTROU.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/cTROU.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/9DFwG.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/9DFwG.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat MPEG-4\nFile Size 1.91 GiB\nOverall Bit Rate 1 416 Kbps\nDuration 3h 4mn\nSample No\nSubtitles No\n\nContainer avc1\nVideo Codec Type x264\nVideo bitrate 1 300 Kbps / 1 300 Kbps\nResolution 720 X 400 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR) 16:9\nQuality Factor(QF) 0.172\nFrame Rate 25.000 fps\nSource me.lol\n\nSpoken language English\nAudio Codec AAC\nBitrate Mode Variable\nBitrate 240 Kbps\nSample Rate 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count 2 channels [Front: L R]\n\n\nRipped by....: oneanight (oan)\nPosted by....: oneanight (oan) on 04 of April 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:639f8e444975ffdbcecb8766dd08e6944b4bedf8","amp;dn":"Ch4+-+Labyrinth+Complete+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"639f8e444975ffdbcecb8766dd08e6944b4bedf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,159,142,68,73,117,255,219,206,203,135,102,221,8,230,148,75,75,237,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

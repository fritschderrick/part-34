Apocalyptic Planet is a combination of science and :\n : adventure that reveals the ways in which our world is constantly moving    :\n : toward its end and how we can change our place within the cycles and       :\n : episodes that rule it.                                                     :\n :                                                                            :\n : In this riveting narrative, Childs makes clear that ours is not a stable   :\n : planet, that it is prone to sudden, violent natural disasters and extremes :\n : of climate. Alternate futures, many not so pretty, are constantly waiting  :\n : in the wings. Childs refutes the idea of an apocalyptic end to the earth   :\n : and finds clues to its more inevitable end in some of the most physically  :\n : challenging places on the globe. He travels from the deserts of Chile, the :\n : driest in the world, to the genetic wasteland of central Iowa to the site  :\n : of the drowned land bridge of the Bering Sea, uncovering the               :\n : micro-cataclysms that predict the macro: forthcoming ice ages,             :\n : super-volcanoes, and the conclusion of planetary life cycles. Childs       :\n : delivers a sensual feast in his descriptions of the natural world and a    :\n : bounty of unequivocal science that provides us with an unprecedented       :\n : understanding of our future.                                               :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f54c8c79350cb776202319362aedfc3705c325f5","amp;dn":"Craig+Childs+Apocalyptic+Planet+2012+Retail+EPUB+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f54c8c79350cb776202319362aedfc3705c325f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,76,140,121,53,12,183,118,32,35,25,54,42,237,252,55,5,195,37,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

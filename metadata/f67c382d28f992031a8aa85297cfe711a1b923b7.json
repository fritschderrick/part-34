They deal with more 21,000 parking disputes a year from everyday motorists fighting to have their fines withdrawn. With exclusive access to courts around the country, the series sees drama unfold as drivers come face to face with lawyers who decide whether to let them off or not.\n \nParking Wars also features footage captured by members of the public on their mobile phones as the civil enforcement officers patrol the streets and receive an increasing amount of abuse Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sometimes through song, and sometimes something more dangerously physical.\n \nIn the first episode, civil enforcement officers in Portsmouth are seen cracking down on errant drivers. Parking attendant Gavin Green says: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I would rather back a donkey in the Grand National than want to come and park in Portsmouth. You would have better odds on the donkey than parking and not getting a ticket.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n \nMeanwhile, the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blue badge investigator looks for motorists using stolen, forged or fraudulent disabled parking passes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f67c382d28f992031a8aa85297cfe711a1b923b7","amp;dn":"Parking.Wars.2015.s01e01.EN.SUB.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f67c382d28f992031a8aa85297cfe711a1b923b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,124,56,45,40,249,146,3,26,138,168,82,151,207,231,17,161,185,35,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Maron\n\n  This textbook on mathematical analysis is based on many years'\n  experience of lecturing at a higher technical college. Its aim is to\n  train the students in active approach to mathematical exercises, as\n  is done at a seminar. Much attention is given to problems improving\n  the theoretical background. Therefore standard computational\n  exercises are supplemented by examples and problems explaining the\n  theory, promoting its deeper understanding and stimulating precise\n  mathematical thinking. Some counter examples explaining the need for\n  certain conditions in the formulation of basic theorems are also\n  included. \n\n  The book is designed along the following lines. Each section opens\n  with a concise theoretical introduction containing the principal\n  definitions, theorems and formulas. Then follows a detailed solution\n  of one or more typical problems. Finally, problems without solution\n  are given, which are similar to those solved but contain certain\n  peculiarities. Some of them are provided with hints. \n\n  These sections should prove of interest to the inquiring student,\n  and possibly also to lecturers in selecting material for classwork\n  or seminars. \n\n  This book was translated from the Russian by Leonid Levant. The book\n  was published by first Mir Publishers in 1973. The book is still in\n  print in Indian edition by CBSPD. \n\n  All credits to the original uploader.\n\n  DJVU | 4.2 MB | Pages: 453 | Cover | OCR\n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\n\nTable of Contents\nFrom the Author 9\nChapter I\nIntroduction to Mathematical Analysis 11\n\nChapter II\nDifferentiation of Functions 98\n\nChapter III\nApplication of Differential Calculus to Investigation of Functions 131\n\nChapter IV\nIndefinite Integrals.

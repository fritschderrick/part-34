For good and for evil, religion is the single greatest influence in the world. We accept as self-evident that competing economic systems (capitalist or communist) or clashing political parties (Republican or Democratic) propose very different solutions to our planet's problems. So why do we pretend that the world's religious traditions are different paths to the same God? We blur the sharp distinctions between religions at our own peril, argues religion scholar Stephen Prothero, and it is time to replace naÃƒï¿½ve hopes of interreligious unity with deeper knowledge of religious differences.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63a4bb6d1253b5d91e0429b4f61152eafe6c1bc1","amp;dn":"Stephen+Prothero+-+God+is+not+one%3A+The+Eight+Rival+Religions+Tha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63a4bb6d1253b5d91e0429b4f61152eafe6c1bc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,164,187,109,18,83,181,217,30,4,41,180,246,17,82,234,254,108,27,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

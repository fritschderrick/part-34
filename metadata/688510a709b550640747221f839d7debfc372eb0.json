The premise of the series, which is based on a pitch by George R. R. Martin, is that the majority of the DC Universe's supervillains -- both major ones (such as Lex Luthor and the Joker) and newer or more obscure ones (such as Scandal and Crazy Quilt) -- have been captured by the Suicide Squad and imprisoned on a distant planet. The story features the villains splitting into alliances and trying to find a way to escape their prison, or choose to rule the planet &quot;Salvation&quot; on which they have landed.\n\nThis torrent collects the complete series issues 1-8","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:688510a709b550640747221f839d7debfc372eb0","amp;dn":"Salvation+Run+Complete+Series+1-8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"688510a709b550640747221f839d7debfc372eb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,133,16,167,9,181,80,100,7,71,34,31,131,157,125,235,252,55,46,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

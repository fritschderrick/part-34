Kane and his group try their best to stop the evil Supers, but they're hopelessly outnumbered. And when the evil Supers put in motion a plan that spells disaster for any Super or human who's not on their side, Kane's not so sure that he and his people can stop them. Not only that, but with the government hunting them down, it looks as if Kane may be on the losing side of an oncoming war between the humans, heroes, and villains. \r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Kirby Heyborne\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nLength: 7 hrs and 3 mins\r\nSeries: The First Superhero, Book 2\r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:11-24-15\r\nPublisher: Tantor Audio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e7eb89f30c9f5cc6f5908e2bd7a880672a79b13","amp;dn":"Logan+Rutherford+-+The+Siege+of+the+Supers+%28The+First+Superhero+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e7eb89f30c9f5cc6f5908e2bd7a880672a79b13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,126,184,159,48,201,245,204,111,89,8,226,189,122,136,6,114,167,155,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

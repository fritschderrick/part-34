J. Davis)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img8.imageshack.us/img8/3191/polchemcover.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img8.imageshack.us/img8/3191/polchemcover.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nProduct Description\n- Written by an international group of experts in the field. The book provides a survey of the literature, emphasising\nthe most useful techniques and reagents.\n- In each chapter, step-by-step protocols, essential background\ninformation and key citations in the literature are included\n- Topical and less well-known techniques are covered\nin a comprehensive but accessible manner for both experts and new comers to the field.\n\nThis book has been\ndesigned to appeal to both chemists working in, and new to, the area of polymer synthesis. It contains detailed\ninstructions for the preparation of a wide-range of polymers by a wide variety of different techniques, and describes\nhow this synthetic methodology can be applied to the development of new materials. It includes details of\nwell-established techniques,e.g. chain-growth or step-growth processes together with more up-to-date examples using\nmethods such as atom-transfer radical polymerisation. Less-well known procedures are also included, e.g. electrochemical\nsynthesis of conducting polymers and the preparation of liquid crystalline elastomers with highly ordered structures.\nOther topics covered include general polymerisation methodology, controlled/'living' polymerisation methods, the\nformation of cyclic oligomers during step-growth polymerisation, the synthesis of conducting polymers based on\nheterocyclic compounds, dendrimers, the preparation of imprinted polymers\nand liquid crystalline polymers. The main\nbulk of the text is preceded by an introductory chapter detailing some of the techniques available to the scientist for\nthe characterisation of polymers, both in terms of their chemical composition and in terms of their properties as\nmaterials. The book is intended not only for the specialist in polymer chemistry, but also for the organic chemist with\nlittle experience who requires a practical introduction to the field. \n\n\n\n\n1.

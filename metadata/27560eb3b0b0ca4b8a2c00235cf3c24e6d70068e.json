DeKnight\nStars:\nJohn Hannah, Manu Bennett and Peter Mensah \n\n\nS1, Ep1\n\nJan. 21, 2011\nPast Transgressions \nA pre-Spartacus prequel about life in the House of Batiatus. In the opener, a younger Batiatus is placed in command of his father's gladiator-training school, which leads him to use one of the most accomplished fighters to curry favor with a nobleman.\n \n\n \nS1, Ep2 \n\nJan. 28, 2011 \nMissio \nA week has passed since he received his severe beating at the hands of Tullius' men and Batiatus has now recovered sufficiently to leave his bed. Tullius sends him a message to the effect that he acted hastily and offers a compromise. Batiatus is in no mood to compromise however and plans his own revenge. Quintillius Varis comes to Capua to select gladiators for his games and Gaia, who knows him, plots to have him come to Batiatus' house. Batiatus will seemingly go to any length to impress Varis but his blind enthusiasm does not sit well with the men. Doctore and Oenomaus settle their differences in the arena.\n \n\n \nS1, Ep3 \n\nFeb. 4, 2011 \nPaterfamilias \nBatiatus is pleased with himself having arranged for Gannicus to appear in the primus of Quintillius Varis' games. He is not however prepared for the return of his father Titus who arrives home to find his son cavorting with Gaia and Lecretia. He treats his son with disdain and has heard of the mess he's made of things with Tullius. He laughs when he hears that Gannicus will represent the house in the games and sets out to undo everything they young Batiatus has managed to arrange. Titus arranges a peace of sorts with Tullius and for several of their gladiators to fight one another in the arena. One of those selected to fight is Crixus, not yet one of the brotherhood of gladiators. While father and son are away, Varis returns to the Batiatus home with a friend, Cossutius, expecting to again experience the pleasures of his previous visit.\n \n\n \nS1, Ep4 \n\nFeb. 11, 2011 \nBeneath the Mask \nThe younger Batiatus is having more than just a bit of difficulty accepting his father's ongoing - and seemingly permanent - presence at home. The patriarch refuses to take on the powerful Tullius and continually tells his son to learn his place. When Gaia sees someone she had once met in Rome, she introduces him to Lucretia and he immediately comments on what he has heard about the pleasures available at her home. Gaia again sees an opportunity to make gains for the House of Batiatus but the elder Batiatus would never allow such revelry in their so they convince him to leave for day or two. At the party, Gaia sees an opportunity to influence Tullius and Lucretia ensures that the occasion is the most elaborate yet. It all turns to tragedy for one of the guests.\n \n\n \nS1, Ep5 \n\nFeb. 18, 2011 \nReckoning \nGaia's death strengthens Quintus Batiatus' resolve to get revenge against Tullius. The elder Batiatus invites Tullius to his home and is offered prime places in the forthcoming games, in return for Gannicus. In the arena, the elder Batiatus has decided to assess the skills of his gladiators, most of whom he is unfamiliar with, by having them fight one another. As for his father's ultimatum that he choose between his home and his wife, the younger Batiatus' attempts to gain time is not appreciated by Lucretia who believes she would have him leave. He convinces her otherwise and she pushes him to settle on his course while she has her own plan. Lucretia also has her own solution to her husband's desire for a son. Melitta and Gannicus increasingly lust after one another. Gannicus finds a solution to their situation but fate presents a different outcome.\n \n\n \nS1, Ep6 \n\nFeb. 25, 2011 \nThe Bitter End \nBatiatus mourns the death of his father and blames Tullius for all that has befallen them. Gannicus pushes Batiatus to complete his sale to Tullius so that he may seek revenge for the House of Batiatus but Solonius counsels caution and a more sensible, if final, solution. Solonius protects his own position as well, however. Naevia replaces Melitta and Lucretia promises that no man will ever touch her as happened to Diona,who makes an unexpected return. The new arena is complete and the games begin. The gladiators of the House of Batiatus emerge triumphant with Crixus and Gannicus wanting to face each other in the primus.\n\nMedia info: averange\n\nGeneral\nUnique ID                        : 253123616686234661866634316899488964189 (0xBE6DD5D6454D5D618873A832EA791E5D)\nComplete name                    : E:\\torrent2\\Spartacus Gods of the Arena (2011)blurayrip.MKV.1080p.AVC.AC3 5.1.ACB-team\\S1,ep1.Past Transgressions.mkv\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFormat version                   : Version 2\nFile size                        : 5.15 GiB\nDuration                         : 52mn 48s\nOverall bit rate mode            : Variable\nOverall bit rate                 : 14.0 Mbps\nMovie name                       : movie\nEncoded date                     : UTC 2012-01-26 19:09:27\nWriting application              : mkvmerge v3.2.0 ('Beginnings') built on Feb 12 2010 16:46:17\nWriting library                  : libebml v0.7.9 + libmatroska v0.8.1\n\nVideo\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot;

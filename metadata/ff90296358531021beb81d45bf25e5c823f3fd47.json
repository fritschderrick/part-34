There are no authentic digital copies of the books anywhere. \n\n\nIve had a hard time finding these files on any file sharing site, and lots of users looking for them, so I delved deep and dug up the core rulebook and its Game Master's book (Further Information : A Gamemaster's Treasury of Time). After looking at the prices for just the core rulebook just I had to upload them.\n\n\n\nenjoy! let me know if there are any problems. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff90296358531021beb81d45bf25e5c823f3fd47","amp;dn":"%5BRPG%5D+C%26deg%3Bntinuum%3A+roleplaying+in+The+Yet+%2B+Further+Informatio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff90296358531021beb81d45bf25e5c823f3fd47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,144,41,99,88,83,16,33,190,184,29,69,191,37,229,200,35,243,253,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

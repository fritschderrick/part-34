Similar in body style to the M7, more than 300 units have been delivered to Metro-North so far, and feature multiple power pick-up Ã¢â‚¬â€œ third rail and overhead pantograph Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which can be changed by the engineer whilst on the move. \n\nThe two-car Kawasaki M8 has a top speed of 100mph (161km/h) and the model for Train Simulator features driving cabs and passenger views, switchable power modes and dynamic in-cab display screens showing instrument readouts and power pick-up mode. \n\nThe locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Metro-North Kawasaki M8 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam.

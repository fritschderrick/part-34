Yet now the consensus is that he made some of the finest pop/rock recordings of his era. Sure, he had more promotional push than any other rock musician of the '50s; no, he wasn't the greatest singer; and yes, Elvis, Gene Vincent, Carl Perkins, and others rocked harder. But Nelson was extraordinarily consistent during the first five years of his recording career, crafting pleasant pop-rockabilly hybrids with ace session players and projecting an archetype of the sensitive, reticent young adult with his accomplished vocals. He also played a somewhat underestimated role in rock &amp; roll's absorption into mainstream America -- how bad could rock be if it was featured on one of America's favorite family situation comedies on a weekly basis?\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-p109220/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-p109220/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):\n\nLegendary Masters compiles all of the hits Ricky Nelson released for Imperial Records in the late '50s, including &quot;Be-Bop Baby,&quot; &quot;Stood Up,&quot; &quot;Lonesome Town,&quot; &quot;It's Late,&quot; &quot;Poor Little Fool,&quot; &quot;Sweeter Than You,&quot; &quot;Just a Little Too Much,&quot; &quot;Never Be Anyone Else but You,&quot; and &quot;Believe What You Say.&quot; A few essential items are missing -- such as the Verve sides &quot;A Teenager's Romance&quot; and &quot;I'm Walking&quot; -- and it would have been nice if the disc had extended into the early '60s, so songs like &quot;Travelin' Man&quot; and &quot;Mary Lou&quot; could have been included, but Legendary Masters remains a vital collection from one of the most undervalued early rock &amp; rollers.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/ricky-nelson-vol-1-the-legendary-masters-series-r13811&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/ricky-nelson-vol-1-the-legendary-masters-series-r13811&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000DRAC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000DRAC&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.

This time though, expect their usual seriously amped visuals and fanatical attention to detail this developer duo have now become renowned for. Featuring exquistely modelled houses, hangars, cafe and many other buildings in the precinct, everything has been based on photos taken on-site and there is a distinct feeling of being at the actual airport itself, such is the authenticity of this scenery. S43 also features a large photoreal area with full seasonal support which seamlessly joins their W16 Monroe project.\n\n    Ground imagery at 30cm per pixel\n    Fully custom modeled airport and houses\n    FSX gmax poly runway, aprons and lights\n    Surrounding farms and housing included\n    Includes the latest Orbx &quot;Flow&quot; technologies\n    Atmospheric night lighting at the airport\n    Dense vegetation options for amazing realism\n    Extensive Control Panel choices for best FPS\n    Includes custom GA AI Traffic movements\n    Photoreal seamlessly joins W16 Monroe\n    Expert 5 seasons color matched imagery\n    By the YHBA/1S2/3W5/KORS/2WA1 team!\n\nBrought to TPB by Capt777.\n\n\nPlease visit my thread in the Suprbay forums.

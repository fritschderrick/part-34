The previous 3 volumes covered the &quot;Messier Objects&quot; in the first volume, and the so-called &quot;Caldwell Objects&quot; in volume two and &quot;Hidden Treasures&quot;n volume three.\nIn this fresh list, Stephen James O'Meara presents 109 new objects for stargazers to observe. The Secret Deep list contains many exceptional objects, including a planetary nebula whose last thermal pulse produced a circumstellar shell similar to the one expected in the final days of our Sun's life  a piece of the only supernova remnant known visible to the unaided eye  the flattest galaxy known  the largest edge-on galaxy in the heavens  the brightest quasar  and the companion star to one of the first black hole candidates ever discovered. Each object is accompanied by beautiful photographs and sketches, original finder charts, visual histories and up-to-date astrophysical information to enrich the observing experience. Featuring galaxies, clusters and nebulae not covered in other Deep-Sky Companions books, this is a wonderful addition to the series and an essential guide for any deep-sky observer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30d2c500cd279fd15d6f2dad1627023060a429ca","amp;dn":"Deep-Sky+Companions+-+The+Secret+Deep+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30d2c500cd279fd15d6f2dad1627023060a429ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,210,197,0,205,39,159,209,93,111,45,173,22,39,2,48,96,164,41,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

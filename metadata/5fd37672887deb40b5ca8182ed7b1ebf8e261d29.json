After downloading simply log onto a Wifi network, choose a spoof to use and press start.\nPlease note that there is no intention for Network Spoofer to include any malicious features. This application is a fun demonstration of how vulnerable home networks are to simple attacks, with permission of the network owner - DO NOT attempt to use Network Spoofer on any corporate or other non-residential networks (eg. at school, university). It becomes very obvious when Network Spoofer is being used on a Network, and use of Network Spoofer will be considered malicious hacking by network administrators.\nHave fun with this one\n\nSeed and Enjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fd37672887deb40b5ca8182ed7b1ebf8e261d29","amp;dn":"NetSpoofer-Andriod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fd37672887deb40b5ca8182ed7b1ebf8e261d29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,211,118,114,136,125,235,64,181,202,129,130,237,123,30,191,142,38,29,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

And if that fantasy honky-tonk lights your Marlboro, you need to know about Honey Island Swamp Band... --Broward-Palm Beach New Times\nProduct Description\n\nIn 2005 guitarists/songwriters Chris Mule and Aaron Wilkinson were left homeless in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, marooned in San Francisco, and mulling an uncertain future with fellow refugees, bassist Sam Price drummer Garland Paul. Honey Island Swamp Band is formed and returns home to New Orleans, quickly gaining recognition as a burgeoning local act. \n\nIn 2010 Trevor Brooks on Hammond B-3 was added, rounding out the band. Their great songs - heavily influenced by the roots music of Lowell George &amp; Little Feat, The Band, Gram Parsons, and New Orleans own Dr. John - and their burn-the-house-down live shows, mark the band as an upcoming regional powerhouse.\n\nIn 2013 Eight years of incessant touring have garnered a sizable fan base across the country. Grammy winner producer, John Porter, comes on board to record their first national release, Cane Sugar . It is Honey Island Swamp Band s own special brew Bayou Americana - a blend of Blues, Southern rock boogie, Appalachian music and New Orleans swamp funk that is decidedly all their own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:defca9c37d06db0229a8a3f72ee13ca0627f5515","amp;dn":"Honey+Island+Swamp+Band+-+Cane+Sugar+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"defca9c37d06db0229a8a3f72ee13ca0627f5515","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,252,169,195,125,6,219,2,41,168,163,247,46,225,60,160,98,127,85,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

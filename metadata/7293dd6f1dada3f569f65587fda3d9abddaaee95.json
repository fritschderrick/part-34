Eight of their albums have reached the Top 40 in the UK Albums Chart, and one of their singles, &quot;The King of Rock 'N' Roll&quot;, peaked at number seven in the UK Singles Chart.\nThe band formed in 1978 in Newcastle. Prefab Sprout have had minimal chart success in the United States. Their 1985 album Steve McQueen was released in the US as Two Wheels Good and peaked at number 180 in the Billboard 200. In spite of limited American success, frontman Paddy McAloon has been hailed as one of the greater songwriters of his era.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefab_Sprout&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefab_Sprout&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Gunman And Other Stories - Prefab Sprout\nreleased 2001\n\n01  Prefab Sprout - The Gunman And Other Stories - Cowboy Dreams\n02  Prefab Sprout - The Gunman And Other Stories - Wild Card in the Pack\n03  Prefab Sprout - The Gunman And Other Stories - I'm A Troubled Man\n04  Prefab Sprout - The Gunman And Other Stories - The Streets Of Laredo/Not Long For This World\n05  Prefab Sprout - The Gunman And Other Stories - Love Will Find Someone For You\n06  Prefab Sprout - The Gunman And Other Stories - Cornfield Ablaze\n07  Prefab Sprout - The Gunman And Other Stories - When You Get To Know Me Better\n08  Prefab Sprout - The Gunman And Other Stories - The Gunman\n09  Prefab Sprout - The Gunman And Other Stories - Blue Roses\n10  Prefab Sprout - The Gunman And Other Stories - Farmyard Cat\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gunman_and_Other_Stories&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gunman_and_Other_Stories&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7293dd6f1dada3f569f65587fda3d9abddaaee95","amp;dn":"Prefab+Sprout+-+The+Gunman+And+Other+Stories+%282001%29++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7293dd6f1dada3f569f65587fda3d9abddaaee95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,147,221,111,29,173,163,245,105,246,85,135,253,163,217,171,221,170,238,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

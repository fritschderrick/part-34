Now with a new afterword describing the security lapses that preceded the attacks of September 11, 2001, Body of Secrets takes us to the inner sanctum of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spy world. In the follow-up to his bestselling Puzzle Palace, James Banford reveals the NSAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hidden role in the most volatile world events of the past, and its desperate scramble to meet the frightening challenges of today and tomorrow.\n\nHere is a scrupulously documented accountÃ¢â‚¬â€œmuch of which is based on unprecedented access to previously undisclosed documentsÃ¢â‚¬â€œof the agencyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tireless hunt for intelligence on enemies and allies alike. Body of secrets is a riveting analysis of this most clandestine of agencies, a major work of history and investigative journalism.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Body-Secrets-Ultra-Secret-National-Security/dp/0385499086/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372088190&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=body+of+secrets&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Body-Secrets-Ultra-Secret-National-Security/dp/0385499086/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372088190&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=body+of+secrets&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b05e9168613e7c23470882f9d11d038eb680a71","amp;dn":"Body+Of+Secrets-Anatomy+Of+The+Ultra-Secret+National+Security+Ag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b05e9168613e7c23470882f9d11d038eb680a71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,5,233,22,134,19,231,194,52,112,136,47,157,17,208,56,235,104,10,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

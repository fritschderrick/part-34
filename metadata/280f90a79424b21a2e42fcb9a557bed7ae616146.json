The performance on this CD dates from the following year and is almost as rewarding. Accompanied by pianist Lou Levy, guitarist Herb Ellis, bassist Wilfred Middlebrooks, and drummer Gus Johnson, she sings 18 songs in a varied and well-paced set. Highlights include &quot;Take the 'A' Train,&quot; &quot;Anything Goes,&quot; &quot;You'll Have to Swing It (Mr. Paganini),&quot; &quot;'Round Midnight,&quot; a new (but less humorous) version of &quot;Mack the Knife,&quot; and an encore, &quot;This Can't Be Love,&quot; that has the singer joined by the Oscar Peterson Trio. \n\nTracks 1 - 19:\nElla Fitgerald with\nLou Levy - Piano\nHerb Ellis - Guitar\nWilfred Middlebrooks - Bass \nGus Johnson - Drums \n\nTrack 20:\nElla Fitzgerald with\nOscar Peterson - Piano\nHerb Ellis - Guitar\nRay Brown - Bass\nEd Thigpen - Drums\n\n01.

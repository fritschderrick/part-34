Jagadish, S. Pearton (Elsevier, 2006).pdf\r\n\r\nWith an in-depth exploration of the following topics, this book covers the broad uses of zinc oxide within the fields of materials science and engineering: \r\n- Recent advances in bulk , thin film and nanowire growth of ZnO (including MBE, MOCVD and PLD), \r\n- The characterization of the resulting material (including the related ternary systems ZgMgO and ZnCdO), \r\n- Improvements in device processing modules (including ion implantation for doping and isolation ,Ohmic and Schottky contacts , wet and dry etching), \r\n- The role of impurities and defects on materials properties \r\n- Applications of ZnO in UV light emitters/detectors, gas, biological and chemical-sensing, transparent electronics, spintronics and thin film","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d5a66ff631e9c95d6b4539a08a27871185d32ea","amp;dn":"Zinc+Oxide+Bulk%2C+Thin+Films+and+Nanostructures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d5a66ff631e9c95d6b4539a08a27871185d32ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,90,102,255,99,30,156,149,214,180,83,154,8,162,120,113,24,93,50,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

One hour with news as you do not see it elsewhere.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHeadlines for Feb 21, 2012\n\n- European Finance Chiefs Approve $172 Billion Greek Bailout\n- Yemen Holds &quot;Election&quot; in Deal to End Saleh's 33-Year Rule\n- Report: Israel to Release Palestinian Hunger Striker Khader Adnan\n- Afghans Protest Koran Burnings at U.S. Airbase at Bagram\n- Spain: Police Criticized for Brutal Beating of Students\n- Donors Pour $22 Million into Super PACs for Republican Candidates\n- Former IMF Chief Held, Questioned in Prostitution Inquiry\n- Syria: 12 Killed in Homs as Red Cross Pushes for Ceasefire\n- Senegal: 3 Dead as Pre-Election Protests Intensify\n- Study: 94% of Oscar Voters Are White, 77% Are Male\n\n\nSpecial reports\n\n- Palestinian Prisoner Khader Adnan to be Released from Israeli Jail After 66-Day Hunger Strike\n\nIsrael's Justice Ministry says that the authorities will not renew the detention of Khader Adnan, a Palestinian prisoner who has been on a hunger strike for 66 days. He is being held in Israel without charge or trial. Under the deal, Adnan will be released on April 17. Doctors previously said Adnan was at immediate risk of death. We speak to three guests about his case: his sister, Maali Mousa; Bill Van Esveld, researcher at Human Rights Watch; and Danny Morrison, a friend of the late Irish republican activist Bobby Sands, who died on his 66th day of a hunger strike in 1981. &quot;[Adnan] told us that, 'I am going on this hunger strike until I have an honorable deal or getting out from this jail,'&quot; said Mousa about her recent visit to see her brother. &quot;But in the same time, his spirits were very high.&quot; Van Esveld accused Israel of violating international law by holding a Palestinian from the West Bank inside Israel. &quot;It's a violation of Israel's obligations under the Geneva Conventions to detain people from the occupied West Bank in prisons, or hospitals, in this case, that are inside Israel,&quot; he said.\n\n\n- Spying on Campus: New York Police Caught Monitoring Muslim Student Groups Throughout Northeast\n\nThe Associated Press has revealed the New York City Police Department monitored Muslim college students at schools throughout the Northeast, including Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania. In one case, the NYPD sent an undercover agent on a whitewater rafting trip in upstate New York, where he recorded students' names and noted in police intelligence files how many times they prayed. We speak to one of the students on the trip, Jawad Rasul. He is the only student who was under surveillance to now publicly speak out about his experience. &quot;[This is] hurting NYPD's try and attempt at finding homegrown terrorism, because these kind of tactics actually create more hatred towards them and the other law-enforcement agencies and really destroys the trust that any youth might have developed with the government,&quot; Rasul said. We're also joined by Mongi Dhaouadi, executive director of the Connecticut chapter of Council on American-Islamic Relations, which is calling for a state probe into the spying on Muslims.\n\n\n- As Calls for Intervention in Syria Grow, Vijay Prashad Urges Reevaluation of NATO Attack on Libya\n\nLibya has just marked the first anniversary of the start of the uprising that toppled Col. Muammar Gaddafi's four-decade rule. But as Libya celebrates a new era free of the Gaddafi regime, there are growing concerns the country's lingering divisions will tear it apart. Libya remains deeply splintered by regions and factions. More than 500 militias exist throughout the country, leading to ongoing human rights abuses that resemble those under the Gaddafi regime. We speak to Trinity College Professor Vijay Prashad. &quot;There is a serious need to evaluate what has happened in Libya as a result not only of the Gaddafi atrocities, of the rise of a rebellion, but also significantly of the nature of the NATO intervention. And that evaluation has not happened,&quot; Prashad said. &quot;I'm afraid that is really calling into question the use of human rights as a lubricant for intervention. If we can't go back and evaluate what has happened, I think a lot of people around the world are afraid of going forward into another intervention, where the lessons of Libya have not been learned.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:740ececbefb9b8276ddb35c4d184c25b9f1bdc47","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+21+feb+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"740ececbefb9b8276ddb35c4d184c25b9f1bdc47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,14,206,203,239,185,184,39,109,219,53,196,209,132,194,91,159,27,220,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

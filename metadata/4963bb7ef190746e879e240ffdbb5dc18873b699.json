That changes when parachutist Dorbeck (also played by Lex Schoorel) lands in his backyard. It turns out the parachutist bears a remarkable resemblance to Ducker. Ducker follows Dorbeck blindly, becomes involved in the Dutch resistance and soon starts killing people. When he escapes through German lines to the freed South Netherlands, no one has ever heard of Dorbeck.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4963bb7ef190746e879e240ffdbb5dc18873b699","amp;dn":"Als+twee+druppels+water+AKA+The+Spitting+Image++%28Fons+Rademakers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4963bb7ef190746e879e240ffdbb5dc18873b699","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,99,187,126,241,144,116,110,135,158,36,15,253,187,93,193,136,115,182,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

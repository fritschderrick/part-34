(This was Comeback #2). Although the title says &quot;Mad Russian&quot; in '70, the contents are actually from that venue in 1968  &amp; from &quot;The Boston Tea Party&quot; in 1970\n\n\nTracklist\n\n1 Lucille 3:22 \n2 Blueberry Hill 4:11 \n3 Midnite Special 3:20 \n4 Ooh Boop Be Doo 3:27\n5 When The Saints Go Marching In 13:14 \n6 Be Bop A Lula 2:36 \n7 You Keep A Knockin' 4:50 \n8 Ready Teddy 1:32 \n9 Jenny Jenny 2:32 \n10 The Girl's Cant't Help It 5:04 \n11 Bonie Moronie 1:38\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ddcbe31c9679c7a76396969fc5390cbba26dada","amp;dn":"Little+Richard++Black+Diamond+%28Live+at+Boston+1970%29%28rock%29%28mp3%4032","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ddcbe31c9679c7a76396969fc5390cbba26dada","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,220,190,49,201,103,156,122,118,57,105,105,252,83,144,203,186,38,218,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

In Paris, a covert agent is close to cracking a terrorist cell. And just north of the equator, a sailboat manned by a drug runner and a pirate is witness to the unspeakable. In one instant, all around the world, everything will change. A wave of inexplicable energy slams into the continental United States. America as we know it vanishes. From a Texas lawyer who happens to be in the right place at the right time to an engineer in Seattle who becomes his cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only hope, from a combat journalist trapped in the Middle East to a drug runner off the Mexican coast, Without Warning tells a fast, furious story of survival, violence, and a new, soul-shattering reality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:205c025b28992c76a8be7b4927314c9bf75df5c9","amp;dn":"John+Birmingham++-+Without+Warning+%28.PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"205c025b28992c76a8be7b4927314c9bf75df5c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,92,2,91,40,153,44,118,168,190,123,73,39,49,76,155,247,93,245,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

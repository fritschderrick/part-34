A 30 minute record highlights version will be broadcast on British Eurosport 2 at 18:00 GMT.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize__: 679+516 MB\nRun-Time__: 66+54 min\nContainer_: MKV\nVideo_____: x264 CABAC L3.1 832x468 25fps bitdepth=10 chroma=4:2:0 CRF 25\nAudio_____: HE-AAC 96Kbps ABR 2 channels 48KHz +10dB\n\nCRF 25 (10bit) is roughly equivalent to CRF 23 (8bit).\nThe SD source is 544x576i with 16 pixel horizontal cropping giving a useable encode width of 528. W-Zoom is therefore 832/528 or about 157%.\nCropping is also applied vertically to keep the aspect error less than 0.2%\nThe SD source filesizes are: 1.54GB and 1.18GB.\n\nTo play Hi10p you'll need to use a modern software player. It won't play with any hardware player or GPU assisted player because the video chipsets only support consumer level AVC spec, i.e. bitdepth=8bits and chroma=4:2:0. Hi422p and Hi444p are better but they take longer to encode. The idea is to use the lowest quantizer but keep the bitrate below 1500Kbps.\n\nHi10p doesn't make the picture quality any better - it just preserves as much information as possible from the mpeg2 source.\nFor better picture quality HD source must be used.\nHere's some 10bit software players: MPC-HC, VLC v2.x.x, XMBC v12, [S]MPlayer[X].\nCPU usage is higher during playback of 10bit depth video.\n\nThe torrents will also be posted at NordixXplained blog - use google to find it.\nIf TPB goes down the torrents will be available from other places at NX.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2171fac55cc8d5eaef2d887397d698146419f9a","amp;dn":"ES+Cross-Country+2012-11-17+Bruksvallsloppet+Hi10p+PDTV+x264+NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2171fac55cc8d5eaef2d887397d698146419f9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,23,31,172,85,204,141,94,174,242,216,135,57,125,105,129,70,65,159,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

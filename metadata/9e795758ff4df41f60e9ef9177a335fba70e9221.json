From a contemporary viewpoint this can be seen to engender a feminist understanding of the ground of being. Unlike other Buddhist texts, the kun byed rgyal po&amp;#039;i mdo invites the reader to rejoice in this world as beautified and intelligible, and thus the innate purity of the intelligent potency, the motherly Buddha, will be experienced.\nIn addition to the translation, the book also includes a discussion of the conceptual and historical contexts of the text, an examination of its leading ideas, and an assessment of the challenges related to the translation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e795758ff4df41f60e9ef9177a335fba70e9221","amp;dn":"The+Sovereign+all+creating+Mind.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e795758ff4df41f60e9ef9177a335fba70e9221","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,121,87,88,255,77,244,31,96,233,239,145,119,163,53,251,167,14,146,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

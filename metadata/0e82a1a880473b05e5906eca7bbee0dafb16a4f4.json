It was during this phase of his radio career that he honed his act, and welcomed on board eventual longtime cast members Fred Norris and Robin Quivers. Perhaps to try cashing in on his fast-rising popularity, Stern and Norris decided to make their own comedy album in 1982, 50 Ways to Rank Your Mother. Over the years, Stern has been very vocal about his dislike for how the album turned out, and much to his pleasure, the album seemed to fade away from view only a few years after its release. But with Stern's popularity skyrocketing by the early '90s, the album was re-released on CD in 1994, with altered cover artwork and under a new title, Unclean Beaver. Be forewarned, this is not a &quot;Best of The Howard Stern Show&quot; from this period, but rather a collection of song parodies and bits created in a recording studio. And it's easy to see why Stern disapproves of the album: it pales in comparison to his radio show and often comes off like a racier (and unfunnier) Weird Al Yankovic album, as evidenced by such selections as &quot;Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, OJ -- Baby You Can Rent a Car&quot; and &quot;Happy Birthday to You.&quot; Stern has gone on to create much funnier and wittier bits than the ones included here, and if its creator has denounced this product countless times, maybe that should tell you something. \n\n\nTracklist .\n\n\n1  Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, OJ - Baby You Can Rent A Car     1:18  \n2  Unclean Beaver, Episode I     4:02  \n3  4 Blacks And A Mac     1:44  \n4  Happy Birthday To You     2:32  \n5  Richard's Family Fewd     0:55  \n6  Barry Off-White's Ode To Howit     3:40  \n7  Assola     0:07  \n8  Havana Hillbillies     1:41  \n9  He's Sick     0:10  \n10  I Shot Ron Regan     4:10  \n11  Howard Stern?     0:07  \n12  Unclean Beaver, Episode II     4:46  \n13  Nail Young's Cat     1:25  \n14  Family Affarce     3:35  \n15  Springstern's Easter Parade     2:49  \n16  50 Ways To Rank Your Mother     5:39  \n17  Howard Stern Is A God     0:30  \n\n\nCredits \nExecutive Producer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Chuck Auster \nProducer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fred Norris, Howard Stern, Millsey Brown \nRecorded By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Millsey Brown \n \n\nBarcode and Other Identifiers \nBarcode: 019011420226\nASIN: B000000N0Z\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e82a1a880473b05e5906eca7bbee0dafb16a4f4","amp;dn":"Howard+Stern+Unclean+Beaver","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e82a1a880473b05e5906eca7bbee0dafb16a4f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,130,161,168,128,71,59,5,229,144,110,202,123,190,224,218,251,22,164,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The film is told as a narrative delivered by John under the pessimism of the early 1990s. A misanthropic shut-in, he deals with his personal issues through a series of disjointed and sometimes imaginary encounters with television personalities, dead relatives, a former liberal turned investment banker, drug users and the unemployment office. Each chapter is bears a varying degree of social commentary. The film climaxes as John loses hope, and his search for meaning turns to self-destruction. John is finally rescued by the charity of an old friend, then resolving to leave Los Angeles and start his life anew.\n\nDirected by\tPeter McCarthy\nProduced by\tPeter McCarthy\nWritten by\tPeter McCarthy\nStarring\nJames LeGros\nJohn Cusack\nEthan Hawke\nLisa Zane\nSteve Buscemi\nBilly Bob Thornton\n\nRelease date:1994\nRunning time:96 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8999052467be3a5d68af0dedd131e0a6415e1acf","amp;dn":"Floundering+-+%5B1994%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8999052467be3a5d68af0dedd131e0a6415e1acf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,153,5,36,103,190,58,93,104,175,13,237,209,49,224,166,65,94,26,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The main miniseries debuted in October 2005, and each issue was released with two variant covers: one by PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rez, and one by Jim Lee and Sandra Hope.\n\nThe series storyline was a sequel to DC's 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths. It revisited characters and concepts from that earlier Crisis, including the existence of DC's Multiverse. Some of the characters featured were alternate versions of comic icons such as an alternate Superman named Kal-L, who came from parallel universe called Earth-Two. A major theme was the nature of heroism, contrasting the often dark and conflicted modern-day heroes with memories of &quot;lighter&quot; and ostensibly more noble and collegial heroes of American comic books' earlier days.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d55c90158c728afce4e032807d6a6209d3719066","amp;dn":"66.Infinite+Crisis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d55c90158c728afce4e032807d6a6209d3719066","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,92,144,21,140,114,138,252,228,224,50,128,125,106,98,9,211,113,144,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

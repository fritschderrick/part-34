Includes liner notes by Neil Slaven.\n\nThis five-disc collection from London's JSP Records brings together 126 sides that Lightnin' Hopkins tracked for the Aladdin, Modern/RPM, and Gold Star labels at the very start of his recording career. Included are the Texas bluesman's first hit, &quot;Katie May&quot; from 1946, &quot;T-Model Blues&quot; from 1949, and arguably the most startling Hopkins composition, the powerful &quot;Tim Moore's Farm,&quot; also from 1949. Most of the tracks are Hopkins solo, playing either acoustic or electric guitar, but he takes a turn at the organ for &quot;Organ Boogie,&quot; a track that shows the same adventuresome liberties with tempo and time that mark all of his work, whatever the instrument. Since his approach and style to the blues never altered throughout his life, a case could be made that these first recordings are the ones to get, but at an astounding 126 tracks, this set is mind-numbing overkill for all but the most devoted fan. Rhino's two-disc Mojo Hand anthology is the place to start for novice listeners drawn to this Texas legend. ~ Steve Leggett\n\nThis collection assembles the best sides from Hopkins' classic period, remastered from carefully selected originals. 126 tracks on 5 CDs.

Perry is a somewhat introverted computer programmer whilst his longtime friend Gordo works in various &quot;self-employed&quot; fields and is also a drug dealer. The story is a masculine character study as the two evolve and adapt to the changes in the post-apocalyptic world.\n\nThe end of every main chapter is followed by a story of the American Founding Fathers. These are somewhat humorous and based on actual events.\n\nApocalypse Nerd has been adapted into a six-episode television series entitled Fallout by the BBC, which should air later this year.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0b09b585c39563869bdb3df4767d94d15678d4a","amp;dn":"Apocalypse+Nerd+%28Peter+Bagge%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0b09b585c39563869bdb3df4767d94d15678d4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,176,155,88,92,57,86,56,105,189,179,223,71,103,217,77,21,103,141,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

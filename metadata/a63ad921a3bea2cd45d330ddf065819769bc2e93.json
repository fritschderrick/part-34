No passwords, etc. Also, be sure to open the 'LumaEmu.ini' file and change the username to something you would use. Also, as stated in my previous torrent, there are certain IP's you should block to prevent companies from seeing you have the 'non-legit' version :)\n \nHope you enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a63ad921a3bea2cd45d330ddf065819769bc2e93","amp;dn":"Space+Engineers+v01.021.029+%5Bx86%2Bx64%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a63ad921a3bea2cd45d330ddf065819769bc2e93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,58,217,33,163,190,162,205,69,211,48,221,240,101,129,151,105,188,46,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

This torrent has a ton of information on growing weed.  It has videos and eBooks on the topic of growing marijuana and staying safe in the process.  The videos are all .avi (using XviD I think) and range from about 30 minutes to 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Meanwhile, some of the eBooks contain only one page of information, while others contain upwards of 400+ pages with full color.  The eBooks are all in .pdf format.. These eBooks and Videos cover vast subjects including; the drug war, how to grow, and how to stay safe during your grow.  These have been downloaded from other torrents on various websites and as such, I take no credit for any of the content, I have merely combined what I believe is worthwhile information.   I wanted to include as much information as possible\n\nNote: This torrent hovers around 4.7 gigs.

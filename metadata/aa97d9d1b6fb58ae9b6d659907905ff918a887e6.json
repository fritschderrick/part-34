Forster\n\n[Complete cast listing available from IMDB.\n\n***\n\nIt's been difficult for me to obtain any one description that does justice to the film or the novel its based upon, and even more so to write one myself. Ostensibly it's about the interaction between three highly different families from three widely separated social classes and their slow, inevitable, and sometimes tortuous collision with one another. Howards End, the Wilcoxes' eponymous estate, becomes as main of a character as any throughout the novel and film; and though a large part of the action takes place in the urban areas of London, an eventual return to Howards End becomes the &quot;touching point&quot; for the characters and heralds a major development. The cast is superb even for a Merchant-Ivory film, and I highly recommend this one and the novel it's based upon (one of my favorites in any language,) to all those who are curious. \n\nOne IMDB reviewer spoke of the film, and specifically, Emma Thompson's performance as Meg Schlegel in this way:\n\nIf it's raining, if it's late, if I'm tired of working, if I'm restless or if I'm in a quandary of sorts, &quot;Howard's End&quot;. I put the film on and Emma Thompson - presumably with the help of her accomplices, Ivory, Jhavhala, Hopkins etc - takes me away from whatever mood I'm trying to escape and leads me through her own, brilliantly drawn, gently torturous path. I don't recall when was the last time an actress has had this kind of power over my own psyche. The film is constructed with an Ivory attention to detail worthy of a vintage Visconti. The screenplay has no lapses of any kind and never falls into the usual traps. Loyal to its source material and yet, cinematic in the most revolutionary traditional sense of the word. The Britishness of Anthony Hopkins character is turned upside down giving us a glimpse into a character that's a mass of contradictions. But it is Emma Thompson's film from beginning to end. What a glorious achievement.\n\nThis is by far my favorite Redgrave film, and an extremely close second in terms of Hopkins's role, my favorite of his being 84 Charing Cross Road. It's an incredibly engrossing film that can be watched day or night, time and time again. Redgrave's part is played with a remarkable sensitivity; and in all honesty, I can't really think of anything I don't like about it.\n\n(Great pains have been taken to ensure this was an improvement over the version currently available on the Pirate Bay, as well as the one floating around various private trackers. It was a labor of love and some frustration from start to finish - being the first time I have used Gordian Knot with any efficacy at all, haha.. Since the original AC3 audio track was extremely quiet I've taken the liberty of normalizing it before the upload, and haven't noticed any problems in sync or a loss in quality. In retrospect, maybe I should of cranked the bitrate up a bit more for such a long film, but ~1400kb/s suits it well. I'm a little disappointed how it looks when stretching to fullscreen, but am at least glad that I did my best in translating an extremely lush and high-quality film to a semi-portable file. If you end up enjoying it, Criterion printed a limited run of most of the Merchant-Ivory films under the Merchant Ivory Collection banner.)\n\nNow, the specs!\n\n***\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : Howards End.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.61 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 22mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 620 Kbps\nWriting application              : Nandub v1.0rc2\nWriting library                  : Nandub build 1852/release\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 2h 22mn\nBit rate                         : 1 227 Kbps\nWidth                            : 640 pixels\nHeight                           : 272 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.35\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.294\nStream size                      : 1.22 GiB (76%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.0.3 (UTC 2004-12-20)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 2h 22mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 384 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 391 MiB (24%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 500 ms\n\nPersonal rip.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://freakyflicks.proboards54.com/index.cgi?board=6&amp;action=display&amp;thread=3588&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://freakyflicks.proboards54.com/index.cgi?board=6&amp;action=display&amp;thread=3588&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n***\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.

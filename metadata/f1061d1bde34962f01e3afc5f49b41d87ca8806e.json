Far from gorging on sumptuous food and wine, lying on ravishing beaches and enjoying breathtaking architecture, Paul will be exploring some of the lesser-known areas of the continent. &quot;Prepare to see Europe like you've never seen it before,&quot; he promises.\n\nPart1:\nBeginning in Germany, Paul meets the leader of a political movement known as the Apple Front, before enjoying a 'chess boxing' match in a Berlin sports hall. Next, he meets a former truck driver who practises the dying art of giant bunny breeding, and samples the delights of naked bowling. The first leg of PaulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tour ends with a bizarre spa treatment in a hotel on the Austrian border. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.five.tv/programmes/documentaries/paul-merton-in-europe/57175&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.five.tv/programmes/documentaries/paul-merton-in-europe/57175&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Specs for Std Def\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1600Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.800\nFrames per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 160Kbps 48KHz\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 45mins\nPart Size: 568MB\nNumber of Parts: 6\nSubtitles: Not Available\nripped by: JungleBoy\nSource: DVB-T\n\nforums[dot]mvgroup[dot]org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1061d1bde34962f01e3afc5f49b41d87ca8806e","amp;dn":"Paul+Merton+in+Europe+1of6+PDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1061d1bde34962f01e3afc5f49b41d87ca8806e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,6,29,27,222,52,150,47,1,227,175,197,244,155,65,216,124,168,128,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

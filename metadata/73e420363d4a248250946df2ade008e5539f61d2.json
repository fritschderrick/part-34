In fact, it has a rich tradition stretching back hundreds of years. This entertaining and enlightening anthology--the first of its kind--gathers nearly one hundred fascinating selections from the past 500 years of popular math writing, bringing to life a little-known side of math history. Ranging from the late fifteenth to the late twentieth century, and drawing from books, newspapers, magazines, and websites, A Wealth of Numbers includes recreational, classroom, and work mathematics; mathematical histories and biographies; accounts of higher mathematics; explanations of mathematical instruments; discussions of how math should be taught and learned; reflections on the place of math in the world; and math in fiction and humor.\nFeaturing many tricks, games, problems, and puzzles, as well as much history and trivia, the selections include a sixteenth-century guide to making a horizontal sundial; &quot;Newton for the Ladies&quot; (1739); Leonhard Euler on the idea of velocity (1760); &quot;Mathematical Toys&quot; (1785); a poetic version of the rule of three (1792); &quot;Lotteries and Mountebanks&quot; (1801); Lewis Carroll on the game of logic (1887); &quot;Maps and Mazes&quot; (1892); &quot;Einstein's Real Achievement&quot; (1921); &quot;Riddles in Mathematics&quot; (1945); &quot;New Math for Parents&quot; (1966); and &quot;PC Astronomy&quot; (1997). Organized by thematic chapters, each selection is placed in context by a brief introduction.\nA unique window into the hidden history of popular mathematics, A Wealth of Numbers will provide many hours of fun and learning to anyone who loves popular mathematics and science.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/6df2/c80ec284.png[/img]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73e420363d4a248250946df2ade008e5539f61d2","amp;dn":"A+Wealth+of+Numbers%3A+An+Anthology+of+500+Years+of+Popular+Mathem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73e420363d4a248250946df2ade008e5539f61d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,228,32,54,61,74,36,130,80,148,109,242,173,224,8,229,83,159,97,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

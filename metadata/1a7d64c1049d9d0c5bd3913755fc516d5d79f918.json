The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) established the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) to, among other things, co-ordinate the nation's efforts to prepare for, prevent, and respond to cyber threats to systems and communications networks. The authors' objectives were to: identify key attributes of cyber analysis and warning capabilities, compare these attributes with US-CERT's current capabilities to identify whether there are gaps, and also identify US-CERT's challenges to developing and implementing key attributes and a successful national cyber analysis and warning capability. To address these objectives, the authors identified and analysed related documents, observed operations at numerous entities, and interviewed responsible officials and experts.\n\n\n\n\nscanned with Kaspersky  + SuperAntiSpyware + Malwarebytes = Malware FREE\n\nENJOY\n       scuba-doo\n\n\nshare the wealth and seed, comments are more then welcome","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a7d64c1049d9d0c5bd3913755fc516d5d79f918","amp;dn":"Cybersecurity%2C+Cyberanalysis+and+Warning+%28scuba-doo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a7d64c1049d9d0c5bd3913755fc516d5d79f918","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,125,100,193,4,157,157,12,91,211,145,55,85,252,81,109,93,121,249,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

A notebook is a familiar and natural way to keep things organized, and saves time just like a paper notebook saves time over notes and documents piled on your desk or stuffed in a drawer.\n\nClip Things You Find and Deal With Them Later:\n\nWhether research on the web or to-dos in e-mail, just select and clip it to a page in your Notebooks. Clipping happens in the background so you aren't thrown into another app and forced to spend time regaining your train of thought. And when doing web research NoteBook saves the page's URL with each clipping, so you don't waste time later trying to get back to that page.\n\nNo More Struggling to Organize Projects in the Finder:\n\nThe Finder was designed to work with documents, so it's difficult to add a simple note to a project folder. And if you've ever tried to organize documents in the Finder you've probably resorted to elaborate naming schemes to force them to appear in a particular order. Even after all of this effort, it's still just a long list of stuff.\nWith NoteBook, pages can contain not only text, but also attachments, so you can keep your project's documents right with your notes, stored directly within the Notebook. Double-click an attachment to open and edit it in the app that created it.\n\nFind Anything Instantly, not Eventually:\n\nNoteBook's patented Multidex helps you quickly find things based on what little you remember about them. So if you're looking for a note that mentions someone's name you might see it on the Capitalized Words page. Or if you remember you entered it last Thursday the Creation Dates page shows you everything you added to your Notebook last Thursday. And so on. No more time wasted sifting through hundreds of results from a simple text search.\nThe minutes NoteBook saves you each day add up to extra hours each week.\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\nPPC / Intel\nMac OS X 10.5.8 or later","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a683201feedc35df9c7d3bb1061dada4b6152202","amp;dn":"Circus+Ponies+NoteBook+3.1.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a683201feedc35df9c7d3bb1061dada4b6152202","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,131,32,31,238,220,53,223,156,125,59,177,6,29,173,164,182,21,34,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Nik SoftwareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Viveza is a powerful and intuitive software tool designed to enable photographers of all skill levels to precisely select and control the light and color in photographic images while working within Photoshop.\nBy incorporating Nik SoftwareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revolutionary U Point technology, Viveza provides easy-to-use methods for correcting and enhancing images without the need to create complicated selections or layer masks or have expert-level knowledge of Adobe Photoshop.\nU Point is the core technology that powers Viveza and brings Photoshop users unprecedented efficiency and control for editing digital images. To make adjustments to an image, users simply place U Point powered Color Control Points directly on colors or objects in an image (such as sky, skin, grass, etc.) then adjust easy-to-use sliders for brightness, contrast, color and more.\nViveza automatically selects objects and creates masks based on where the user places a Color Control Point. By working directly on the image, powerful selective enhancements can be accomplished in a fraction of the time needed by using other methods.\nDOWNLOAD NIK SOFTWARE VIVEZA v1.001 BUILD 4198 PLUG-IN FOR PHOTOSHOP.

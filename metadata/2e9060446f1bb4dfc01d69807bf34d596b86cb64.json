A person who misses it has indeed missed a great amount of good. If a believing person is zealous to obey his Lord and increase the good deeds in his record, he should strive to encounter this night and to pass it in worship and obedience. If this is facilitated for him, all of his previous sins will be forgiven.\n\nBecome a Muslim\nClick here for Live Chat:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://server.iad.liveperson.net/hc/78464536/?cmd=file&amp;file=chatFrame&amp;site=78464536&amp;SV!skill=English&amp;referrer=http%3A//www.islamhouse.com/s/9661&amp;referrer=http%3A//www.islamhouse.com/s/9661&amp;bId=14&amp;sessionkey=H1336330871104499054-5800221294296044033K208654&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://server.iad.liveperson.net/hc/78464536/?cmd=file&amp;file=chatFrame&amp;site=78464536&amp;SV!skill=English&amp;referrer=http%3A//www.islamhouse.com/s/9661&amp;referrer=http%3A//www.islamhouse.com/s/9661&amp;bId=14&amp;sessionkey=H1336330871104499054-5800221294296044033K208654&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e9060446f1bb4dfc01d69807bf34d596b86cb64","amp;dn":"How+to+Seek+Laylat-ul-Qadr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e9060446f1bb4dfc01d69807bf34d596b86cb64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,144,96,68,111,27,180,223,192,29,105,128,123,243,77,89,107,134,203,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Connections to the post-Crisis, pre-New 52 universe end here. All issues have been retitled and numbered in reading order (or at least the closest I could come to it).\n\nWHAT'S INCLUDED: Every Batman comic from 2006 to 2013 written by Morrison, including The Return of Bruce Wayne and relevant pages from 52, DC Universe 0, and Final Crisis\n\nWHAT'S NOT INCLUDED: Chris Burnham's Batman Incorporated vol. 2 #11, tie-in comics from other series for Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul, Batman: R.I.P., Final Crisis, and Battle for the Cowl\n\n\n\nDC made a mess of this run with their original screwy release scheduling, so I've tried to put them all in a reading order that makes sense. Enjoy it.\n\nThanks to Minutemen, Zone-Empire and DCP, who keep us all reading.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6401de64f984d766f1600d2a66f08c4a20ddcbc5","amp;dn":"Grant+Morrison%27s+Batman+%282006-2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6401de64f984d766f1600d2a66f08c4a20ddcbc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,1,222,100,249,132,215,102,241,96,13,42,102,240,140,74,32,221,203,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

For the last eighteen months, ex-Michelin-starred chef, Nick, has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego.\n\n \n\nYet, despite debts of Ã‚Â£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making. Gordon forces him to face his failures, strips down the menu and dismantles the claustrophobic dining room.\n\n \n\nBut when he discovers the depths of Nick&amp;#039;s stubbornness - and that he&amp;#039;s locked him out of the restaurant (a Kitchen Nightmares&amp;#039; first), even Gordon is forced to face the prospect of failure. Will Nick ever get up to speed and recapture his glory days, or will he carry on sleep-walking his way to disaster?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e079da96e57675d8ba26c9e44466b822815bd4b","amp;dn":"Ramsays.Kitchen.Nightmares.S04E03.WS.PDTV.XviD-REMAX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e079da96e57675d8ba26c9e44466b822815bd4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,7,157,169,110,87,103,93,139,162,108,158,68,70,107,130,40,21,189,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

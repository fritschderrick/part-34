One of the first popular alternative rock bands, R.E.M. gained early attention due to Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style and Stipe's unclear vocals. R.E.M. released its first single, &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot;, in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur, and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single &quot;The One I Love&quot;. The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\n\nBy the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R.E.M. was viewed by subsequent acts such as Nirvana and Pavement as a pioneer of the genre and released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band's established sound. R.E.M.'s 1994 release, Monster, was a return to a more rock-oriented sound. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Buck, Mills, and Stipe continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. R.E.M. disbanded in September 2011, announcing the split on its website. \n\n\n\n\n\nLive At The Olympia 2009\n\n\nLive at The Olympia is a live album[4] by American alternative rock band R.E.M.. It is a recording of five-night residency the band held at Dublin, Ireland's Olympia Theatre between June 30 and July 5, 2007, and released on October 27, 2009.[5] In this series of &quot;working rehearsals&quot; many songs on Accelerate were debuted, with many of them still as works in progress.[6] The album is a two-CD release, and contains a total of 39 songs.[7] In addition, a DVD with a documentary entitled This Is Not a Show directed by Vincent Moon is included. A special edition box set containing the album on 4 LPs as well as the two CDs and the DVD is also available.\n\nTo promote the album, R.E.M.'s Dublin website has full streaming clips of &quot;Driver 8&quot;, &quot;I've Been High&quot;, and &quot;Harborcoat&quot;, along with videos for &quot;Living Well Is the Best Revenge&quot; and clips from the Reckoning EP. The video for &quot;Drive&quot; is available on R.E.M.'s Myspace page. On October 22, 2009, National Public Radio began streaming the entire album for free.[8]\n\nAs with R.E.M.'s first live albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½R.E.M.

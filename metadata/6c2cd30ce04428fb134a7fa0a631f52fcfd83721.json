No one knew what it was supposed to be, but the title alone made us curious. Plus, it was on in the middle of the night right after &quot;Evil Dead&quot; and we had nothing else better to do. What a bizarre surprise. It was very funny and the audience couldn't stop laughing. Some people actually clapped at the end and not because they were glad it was over! You could tell the actors looked like they were having a lot of fun. I don't know about the dvd, but in the theatre it looked and sounded great. Bad production values? Whatever that means it's not what we saw. Maybe it's because we all had nowhere else to go, but it was sure a memorable, silly experience. \n\n\nSCREENS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/pabihaadh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/pabihaadh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/pabijaadh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/pabijaadh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/pabilaadh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/pabilaadh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/pabimaadh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/pabimaadh.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSeed and enjoy folks!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c2cd30ce04428fb134a7fa0a631f52fcfd83721","amp;dn":"Hot+Wax+Zombies+On+Wheels+%281999%29+-+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c2cd30ce04428fb134a7fa0a631f52fcfd83721","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,44,211,12,224,68,40,251,19,74,127,160,166,49,245,47,207,216,55,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

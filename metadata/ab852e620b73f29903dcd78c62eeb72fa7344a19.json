However, animation is still in progress and much of the film is still in pencil test - very beautiful pencil tests, at that! There are also a lot of storyboards.\n\n   &quot;Mine Mine Mine&quot; has its original (much better) ending here, where the forest has been utterly devastated by Radcliffe's men, and looks like a bomb hit it. The deleted love song &quot;If I Never Knew You&quot; is also here.\n\n\n   This appears to have been animator Glen Keane's own VHS copy at some point.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab852e620b73f29903dcd78c62eeb72fa7344a19","amp;dn":"Pocahontas+Disney+Unfinished+Workprint+1995","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab852e620b73f29903dcd78c62eeb72fa7344a19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,133,46,98,11,115,242,153,3,220,215,140,98,238,183,47,167,52,74,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

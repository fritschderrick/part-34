Born February 20, 1937, in Chillicothe, OH, Wilson first attracted notice performing the club circuit in nearby Columbus; she quickly earned a growing reputation among jazz players and fans, and she was recording regularly by the late '50s, eventually signing to Capitol and issuing LPs including 1959's Like in Love and Nancy Wilson with Billy May's Orchestra. Her dates with Shearing, including 1960's The Swingin's Mutual, solidified her standing as a talent on the rise, and her subsequent work with Adderley -- arguably her finest recordings -- further cemented her growing fame and reputation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8867df54af4dc3d2077610680e4ed9487d1bf06","amp;dn":"Nancy+Wilson+-+Best+Of+The+Capitol+Years+%5B1995%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8867df54af4dc3d2077610680e4ed9487d1bf06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,134,125,245,74,244,220,61,32,119,97,6,128,228,237,148,135,209,191,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

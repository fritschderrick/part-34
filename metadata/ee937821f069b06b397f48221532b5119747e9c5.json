Two years before his fateful first studio collaboration with Brian Eno (who produced this album), Budd was creating hypnotic music in an acoustic mode. All of the works herein--including &quot;Two Rooms,&quot; whose latter half is an adaptation of John Coltrane's &quot;After the Rain&quot;--sustain a similarly dreamy vibe. An important credo for Budd was to make music as pretty as possible as an antidote to the noisy avant-garde he had escaped from. One cannot fault him for the lovely sounds he creates here, although fans familiar with his more cinematic works might be caught off-guard. Regardless, the pleasant Pavilion of Dreams provides insight into Budd's past, and it offers the same somniferous effect as a gentle lullaby, making it perfect for late-evening listening. --Bryan Reesman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee937821f069b06b397f48221532b5119747e9c5","amp;dn":"%5B1978%5D+The+Pavillion+of+Dreams+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee937821f069b06b397f48221532b5119747e9c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,147,120,33,240,105,176,107,57,127,72,34,21,50,181,17,151,71,233,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It was released (in both the U.S. and the UK) as a 7&quot; single with &quot;Spirit&quot; as the B-side and as a 12&quot; single with &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; and &quot;Red Eye&quot; on side A and &quot;Spirit&quot; on side B.\n\nThis was Sade&amp;#039;s first top ten hit in the U.S., peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for two weeks in May of 1985. The song spent 13 weeks in the Top 40 and also topped the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart for two weeks. Although &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; was Sade&amp;#039;s breakthrough hit on the American music charts, &quot;Your Love Is King&quot; was the band&amp;#039;s first top ten hit in the UK.\n\nThe song is about a fashionable man who lives a jet-set lifestyle. He&amp;#039;s very popular with the ladies, and breaks a lot of hearts in his travels. With the lyrics, &quot;Across the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale,&quot; it&amp;#039;s implied that the women he uses also supply his wealth. It&amp;#039;s also clear that he does not return the affections of these women, as Sade sings near the end, &quot;His heart is cold.&quot;\n\nThe video for &quot;Smooth Operator&quot;, directed by Julian Temple, was nominated for two MTV Video Music Awards for &quot;Best Female Video&quot; and &quot;Best New Artist&quot; in 1985.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:034e06efc1221f37f17721cdf7b5d593fa07ba4b","amp;dn":"Sade+-+Smooth+Operator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"034e06efc1221f37f17721cdf7b5d593fa07ba4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,78,6,239,193,34,31,55,241,119,33,205,247,181,213,147,250,7,186,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

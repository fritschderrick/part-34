It is sung by Elton John. This is one of the better songs sung by Elton as it has a very important meaning for us.\n\nThe meaning is this: success and defeat is part and parcel of life. Sometimes you are down, but you won't be down forever. You will rise again to greater heights.\n\n \nThis song has a special place in my heart.\n\nLyrics\n------\n\nWritten by Alan Menken\nfrom Rocky V soundtrack\n\nThese battered hands are all you own\nThis broken heart just turned to snow\nGo hang your glories on the wall\nThere comes a time when castles fall\nAnd all that's left is shifting in the sand\n\nYou're out of time, you're out of place\nLook at your face\nThat's the measure of a man\n\nThis coat that fits you like a glove\nThese dirty streets you learned to love\nSo welcome back my long lost friend\nYou've been to hell and back again\nAnd God alone knows how you crossed that span\n\nBack on the beat, back to the start\nTrust in your heart\nThat's the measure of a man\n\nIt's the fire in the eyes, the lines on the hand\nIt's the things you understand\nPermanent ties from which you once ran\nThat's the measure of a man\n\nYou've come full circle, now you're home\nWithout the gold, without the chrome\nAnd this is where you've always been\nYou had to lose so you could win\nAnd rise above your troubles while you can\n\nNow you can love, now you can lose\nNow you can choose\nThat's the measure of a man\n\nIt's the fire in the eyes, the lines on the hand\nIt's the things you understand\nPermanent ties from which you once ran\nThat's the measure of a man\n\nYou've come full circle, now you're home\nWithout the gold, without the chrome\nAnd this is where you've always been\nYou had to lose so you could win\nAnd rise above your troubles while you can\n\nNow you can love, now you can lose\nNow you can choose\nThat's the measure of a man\n\n\n\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive 25.All My torrents are here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Hyperdrive25&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Hyperdrive25&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nRemember To Keep Seeding.

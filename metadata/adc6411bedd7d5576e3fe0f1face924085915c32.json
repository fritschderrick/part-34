The first volume appears as Lect. Notes Physics, Vol. 698 &quot;Supersymmetric Mechanics , Vol .1: Supersymmetry, Noncommutativity and Matrix Models&quot; (2006) ISBN: 3-540-33313-4.\n\nThe present extensive lecture supplies a pedagogical introduction, at the non-expert level, to the attractor mechanism in space-time singularities. In such a framework, supersymmetry seems to be related to dynamical systems with fixed points, describing the equilibrium state and the stability features of the thermodynamics of black holes. After a qualitative overview, explicit examples realizing the attractor mechanism are treated at some length; they include relevant cases of asymptotically flat, maximal and non-maximal, extended supergravities in 4 and 5 dimensions. A number of recent advances along various directions of research on the attractor mechanism are also given.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adc6411bedd7d5576e3fe0f1face924085915c32","amp;dn":"Supersymmetric+Mechanics+-+Vol.+2+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adc6411bedd7d5576e3fe0f1face924085915c32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,198,65,27,237,215,213,87,110,63,224,241,250,206,146,64,133,145,92,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

It was broadcast nationwide on 54 radio stations for two hours on weekday evenings between 1995 and 1998.\n\nThe program was known for its wit and satire, but also, as both performers constantly admitted, a large degree of toilet humour. The use of such low-brow comedy was frequently mocked by the hosts themselves. They caused occasional controversy, such as when they made repeated fun of Mal Colston's son for shouting at the media camped outside Colston's family home.\n\nMuch of the show consisted of banter between Martin and Molloy, interspersed with music and sketches. These sketches frequently lampooned celebrities, with impersonations provided by Martin. The show's announcer, Pete Smith regularly participated in sketches, often lampooning his own image as a former Sale of the Century announcer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d238556fe6f442dec5084abbf865561d7a6afe87","amp;dn":"Martin+%2F+Molloy+-+Complete+Collection+%5B3+Albums+-+MP3%5D+%5B1995+-+9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d238556fe6f442dec5084abbf865561d7a6afe87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,56,85,111,230,244,66,222,197,8,74,187,248,101,86,29,122,106,254,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

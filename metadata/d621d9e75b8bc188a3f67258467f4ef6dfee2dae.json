When he finally settled back into town, Freddie was forced to move out of his new apartment by toxic Chinese drywall that was wrecking the place. It's always been this tough, and it always will be. \n\n&quot;Chasing Tha Blues&quot; takes you on a rough ride through Freddie's life. You get to meet &quot;Crackho Flo&quot; and hang out at the &quot;Bucket of Blood&quot;. It's all in the songs. No matter whether it's at home at BJ's Lounge, on the road in New York, or overseas, the vocals are made of grit and tears, and the guitar licks can't be written down. The power is in the spaces between the notes.\n\nLittle Freddie King creates raw urban blues with a gritty spirit that is the authentic thing. He was born in McComb, Mississippi and is the last of the 'great country blues guitar players'. Freddie is a cousin of the late great Lightnin Hopkins and a cultural treasure in the Mississippi and Louisiana region and New Orleans area. ]\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 Born Dead 4:38 \n2 Crackho Flo 3:45 \n3 Louisiana Train Wreck 3:32 \n4 Got Tha Blues On My Back 4:50 \n5 Pocket Full Of Money 3:57 \n6 Back In New Orleans 4:00 \n7 King Freddie's Shuffle 5:25 \n8 Great Great Bamboozle 3:45 \n9 Night Time In Treme 4:46 \n10 Bywater Craw l4:34 \n11 Standin' At Yo Door 5:07 \n12 Mixed Bucket Of Blood 3:23\n\nPersonnel:\n\nLittle Freddie King (vocals, guitars)\nRobert Lewis DiTullio, Jr. (harp)\nAnthony Anderson (bass guitar)\n&quot;Wacko&quot; Wade Wright (drums).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d621d9e75b8bc188a3f67258467f4ef6dfee2dae","amp;dn":"Little+Freddie+King++Chasing+Tha+Blues+%282012%29%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Bro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d621d9e75b8bc188a3f67258467f4ef6dfee2dae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,33,217,231,91,139,193,136,163,246,114,88,70,127,78,246,223,238,45,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

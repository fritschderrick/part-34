They were begun in 1948, in honour of the first Director-General of the BBC, John Reith.\n\nREITH LECTURES 2003\nThis year&amp;#039;s Reith lecturer is the noted neuroscientist Vilayanur S. Ramachandran,  Director of the Centre for Brain and Cognition and professor with the Psychology Department and the Neurosciences Programme at the University of California, San Diego. He is also Adjunct Professor of Biology at the Salk Institute.\n\nLECTURE 1: PHANTOMS IN THE BRAIN \nScientists need no longer be afraid to ask the big questions about what it means to be human with empirical evidence now answering ancient philosophical questions about meaning and existence.\n\nLECTURE 2: SYNAPSES AND THE SELF \nScientists need no longer be afraid to ask the big questions about what it means to be human with empirical evidence now answering ancient philosophical questions about meaning and existence.\n\nLECTURE 3: THE ARTFUL BRAIN\nProfessor Ramachandran draws on neurological case studies and work from ethology (animal behavior) to present a new framework for understanding how the brain creates and responds to art. He will use examples mainly from Indian art and Cubism to illustrate these ideas. \n\nLECTURE 4: PURPLE NUMBERS AND SHARP CHEESE\nProfessor Ramachandran demonstrates experimentally that the phenomenon of synesthaesia is a genuine sensory effect. For example, some subjects literally &quot;see&quot; red every time they see the number 5 or green when they see 2. \n\nLECTURE 5: NEUROSCIENCE - THE NEW PHILOSOPHY \nProfessor Ramachandran argues that neuroscience, perhaps more than any other discipline, is capable of transforming man&amp;#039;s understanding of himself and his place in the cosmos. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0b1e1c6b86e1eb8edf55b07dab7e9aa380d9ee1","amp;dn":"BBC+Reith+Lectures+2003%2C+The+Emerging+Mind","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0b1e1c6b86e1eb8edf55b07dab7e9aa380d9ee1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,177,225,198,184,110,30,184,237,245,91,7,218,183,233,170,56,13,158,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

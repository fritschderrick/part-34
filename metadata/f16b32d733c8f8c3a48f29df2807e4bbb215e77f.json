She works as a nurse in Nazi Germany. Her lover Hanna, being accused of political subversive conduct, becomes a dangerous liaison for Traude, as lesbianism is not tolerated and worse, Hannah?s communist sympathies can easily lead to death under the Nazi regime.\n\nAll her life, Traude devotes herself entirely to the beauty of music, ?real music, not negro jungle music?, (as she bluntly puts it in the film as an indication of her traditional nationalist values); and for decades after the war she gives piano lessons to convicts as part of the correction facility?s rehabilitation program.\n\nOne day, she meets the convicted young woman of Jenny von Loeben, a child prodigy on the piano. Traude now aims at giving Jenny a concert pianist standard education, not to let such talent wither away in prison. Perhaps she has a few more personal reasons for doing so.\n\nJenny is a very damaged soul who often will behave very violently; not unlike Nikita in Luc Besson?s film but here there is none of that old-man eroticism of femme fatale theme of the ?movie-sexy? contrasts of female beauty and violence.\n\nBesides some wonderful music being played in the film, such as Beethoven, Schubert and Robert Schumann, there is this absolutely magnificent original score by Annette Focks which eventually turns out as a sort of Robert Schumann remix. Superb!\n\nFour Minutes is the best movie I have seen in quite some time. It is in German. Not finding an English-subbed dvd to buy anywhere, I have made a subbed DivX for upload so you can go search for a proper dvd release to buy in your own country. The original dvd contained optional Spanish subtitles. I have incorporated both English and Spanish subtitles with the file, that will most probably show on any DivX-certified dvd hardware player (usually there?s a DivX logo on the dvd front panel). To activate the subs, press the Subtitle button on your dvd remote.\n\nAlternatively, you can watch it on your computer using a software video player. Simply load the enclosed, separate subs files into your software player. If you want the Spanish subs, it might be a good idea to rename the Spanish .srt file.

Dancing amid the spires of a city called New Ataraxia, there is a woman who can cloud men's minds, leap across buildings as if weightless, unerringly fire twin automatic pistols in the most insane conditions, and disappear in a crowded room. She fights against the political repression of an insane technocratic society, and she comes from a place that no-one in New Ataraxia has ever heard of. Now she's got one hour to save the city from itself.\n\nA high-octane blend of The Shadow, Tomb Raider, retro-punk science fiction and 21st-century Weird Pulp action, Anna Mercury is a headlong adventure serial about a beautiful and mysterious spy-adventurer who is not what she seems!\n\n\nMany thanks to Minutemen's Zone, Locke, The Rain &amp; ShamilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¼","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a699a80e0d058c3a1ddb6275288cf9e6ac6d636e","amp;dn":"Anna+Mercury+1-5+%2B+Artbook+%28Minutemen%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a699a80e0d058c3a1ddb6275288cf9e6ac6d636e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,153,168,14,13,5,140,58,29,219,98,117,40,140,249,230,172,109,99,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

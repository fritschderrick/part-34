He also maps out the external and internal forces that destroyed communism, and the disastrous impact of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“free-marketÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ victory on eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. He affirms the relevance of taboo ideologies like Marxism, demonstrating the importance of class analysis in understanding political realities and dealing with the ongoing collision between ecology and global corporatism.\n\nWritten with lucid and compelling style, this book goes beyond truncated modes of thought, inviting us to entertain iconoclastic views, and to ask why things are as they are. It is a bold and entertaining exploration of the epic struggles of yesterday and today.\nMichael Parenti is one of the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading progressive thinkers. He lectures widely around the country and is the author of Dirty Truths, Against Empire, Democracy for the Few, Land of Idols: Political Mythology in America, and many other books. He lives in Berkeley, California","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaca722d52f0ac1dbb183f676df7e2897eb128b2","amp;dn":"Blackshirts+and+Reds%3A+Rational+Fascism+and+the+Overthrow+of+Comm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaca722d52f0ac1dbb183f676df7e2897eb128b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,202,114,45,82,240,172,29,187,24,63,103,109,247,226,137,126,177,40,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Whist it's good that Parkway got coverage on national tv, I don't believe the production team behind the audio/video did the gig justice. It's lacking in something special. But what footage ever captures the feeling of a live show?\n\nConverted from .TS file that I ripped straight from TV. I used Handbrake to covert the file and it it turned out wonderfully for the size. Basically identical to the original quality.\n\n\nVideo:\nH264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part 10) (avc1) @ 2300 kb/s\n\nAudio:\nStereo MPEG AAC Audio (mp4a) @ 48kHz 160 kb/s\n\nSize:\n463mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:379e304a1e08e3512d8b77109dedc84f6e079ba3","amp;dn":"Parkway+Drive+-+Live+%40+Festival+Hall+%28Tripple+J%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"379e304a1e08e3512d8b77109dedc84f6e079ba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,158,48,74,30,8,227,81,45,139,119,16,157,237,200,79,110,7,155,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

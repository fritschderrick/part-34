As people scramble for answers, a relatively unknown, Romanian politician named Nicolae Jetty Carpathia rises to become secretary-general of the United Nations, promising to restore peace and stability to all nations. What most of the world does not realize is that Carpathia is actually the Antichrist foretold from the Bible. Coming to grips with the truth and becoming born-again Christians, Rayford Steele, his daughter Chloe, their pastor Bruce Barnes, and young journalist Cameron &quot;Buck&quot; Williams begin their quest as the Tribulation Force to help save the lost and prepare for the coming Tribulation, in which God will rain down judgment on the world for seven years.\n \n[edit] Characters\n \nMain article: List of Left Behind Characters\n \n[edit] Tribulation Saint\n \nThe tribulation saints are fictional characters who are converts to Christianity right after the Rapture. They are to face the Antichrist Nicolae Carpathia during the Tribulation, each in accordance with his or her own, divinely-determined destiny.\n \nThe most well known of the Tribulation Saints include Rayford Steele, Chloe Steele, Cameron &quot;Buck&quot; Williams and Bruce Barnes.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Behind&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Behind&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a7fcaac0c9ab89fc30fe07f29c4b7317f0f7f36","amp;dn":"Left+Behind+series+%2812%29+-Tim+LaHaye+%26amp%3B+Jerry+Jenkins%2C+Mobi%2C+K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a7fcaac0c9ab89fc30fe07f29c4b7317f0f7f36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,127,202,172,12,154,184,159,195,15,224,127,41,196,183,49,127,15,127,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

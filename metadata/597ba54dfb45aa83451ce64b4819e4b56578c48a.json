The information contained within Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Kingdom Vol 1: Plague Survival,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is holistic healing mixed with technologically advanced healing. The methods expressed in this book work along with, and greatly boost the body's natural processes, while causing little to no negative side effects, other than those associated with massive microbial die-offs.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“TKV1: Plague SurvivalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will be revealing the most advanced modes of natural herbal therapy, electromedicine, photonic light, ozone supplementation, healing harmonic frequencies and a whole lot more. The innermost processes of the body and it's immune system will be deeply explored, in turn leading to a prominent understanding of the various microbes/pathogens, and how to kill, disable and ultimately remove them.\n\nWhile this book is predominantly a book on the survival and treatment of deadly illnesses, it is also spiritual in nature. So utilizing our divinely triggered ability to heal from within, will also be greatly expounded upon. This in turn, will ensure that if you do not have access the the various devices and substances contained within Ã¢â‚¬Å“TKV1,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ you will still be able to cure the 'incurables,' with highly refined and directed modes of thought.\n\nFound throughout there are going to be segments of ancient teachings and knowledge, as well as quotations from literary geniuses such as Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstein, along with other great minds of the past. When we learn to look at the far off remote past, we can then take the most powerful healing techniques and incorporate them, with the advanced modes of healing in our current epoch.\n\nThis is the first part in what will become &quot;The Kingdom Trilogy,&quot; the goal of which will be, to begin laying the physical, mental and spiritual foundations of the Kingdom of the 'New Era,' that will inevitably be implemented onto this planet.\n\nJoin the revolution of superior healing and awakened perception today!\n\nBook Length: 33,500 Words\nContains: 7 Chapters and 11 Sub Chapters\n\n\n\n***** PDF Password: &quot;kingdom12&quot;  *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:597ba54dfb45aa83451ce64b4819e4b56578c48a","amp;dn":"TKV1%3A+Plague+Survival","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"597ba54dfb45aa83451ce64b4819e4b56578c48a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,123,165,77,251,69,170,131,69,28,230,75,72,25,228,181,101,120,196,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

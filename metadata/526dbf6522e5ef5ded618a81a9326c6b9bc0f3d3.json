So we finally finished our first community playlist. I know a lot of you guys have been anxiously waiting for this one and have been much more excited about this rather than the monthly Indie/Rock playlist I upload. Have really been enjoying everyones selections and I hope you guys enjoy it too.\n\nFor those of you who have just come across this or not sure how it works... This playlist was put together by the members at www.BlalocksIRP.com each member had the opportunity to post one song they would like to be included on the list. Once the list surpassed 100 tracks I uploaded it here. I am now accepting submissions for the second community playlist. You can submit your song here:\n\nMuch thanks to everyone who submitted. Looking forward to the next one and sharing the December Indie/Rock Playlist with you guys.\nBe on the lookout for a best of 09 playlist soon as well!\n-Blalock's Indie/Rock Playlist\nwww.BlalocksIRP.com\n\n110 Tracks\n--------Tracklist (User who submitted song in brackets)--------\nPedro The Lion - Bad Diary Days [Blalock]\nThe Decemberists - Sleepless [Prateek]\nVampire Weekend - Walcott [TyeDyeHumps]\nEmpire Of The Sun - Walking On A Dream [DonkeyTymer]\nThe Limousines - Very Busy People [daKradha]\nAcetate Zero - Dry [Dunnvurr]\nTilly And The Wall - The Freest Man [Kingeh]\nRobert Pollard - The Butler Stands For All Of Us [PeteF3]\nAnathallo - The River [wesleyblalock]\nRyan Adams - Stop [Hellothere]\nThis Mortal Coil - Song To The Siren [Rebjukebox]\nSophia - Heartache [Cloudy]\nThe Generationals - When They Fight, They Fight [sammyjb]\nDiscovery - So Insane [mrkman]\nPhoenix - Armistice [garen]\nDear Reader - Never Goes [fentiger]\nThe Pixies - Hey [enderbean]\nThe Elected - Biggest Star [fakefrench]\nLemonade - Big Weekend [keithdemitri]\nCompany Of Thieves - In Passing [fro lee]\nThe Federals - Transistor 1969 [barnet_lady]\nSomeone Still Loves You Boris Yeltsin - Some Constellation [DesireeN]\nGuster - Satellite [DigitalLove42]\nBaumer - At Worlds End [Kitsune]\nTaken By Cars - December 2 Chapter VII [cami_019]\nDaft Punk/Coldplay/MGMT - Kids In Technicolor [Elandruss]\nPhantogram - Mouthful Of Diamonds [blip]\nTapes 'N Tapes - In Houston [droenn]\nCake - I Will Survive [leeroberts]\nWhy? - Darla [dvt800m]\nThe Temper Trap - Sweet Disposition [Arcari]\nWhitley - More Than Life [ReadTheFollowin]\nFlorence And The Machine - Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up) [tarnation]\nJohnny Foreigner - Salt, Peppa, and Spinderella [Philip]\nMiike Snow - Silvia [KaylaClarke]\nSchool Of Seven Bells - My Cabal [VacuolateTuna]\nOkkervil River - Another Radio Song [OblivionParadise]\nHey!

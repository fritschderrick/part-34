She's decided to blend her love of classic folk blues with folk music, \n including new folk-rock tunes, along with a slight R&amp;B, New Orleans, and jazz bent and a mellow Californian vibe. Surely, Bonnie Raitt is a record of its times, as much as Jackson Browne's first album is, but with this, she not only sketches out the blueprint for her future recordings, but for the roots music that would later be labeled as Americana. The reason that Bonnie Raitt works is that she is such a warm, subtle singer. She never oversells these songs, she lays back and sings them with heart and wonderfully textured reading. Her singing is complemented by her band, who is equally as warm, relaxed, and engaging. This is music that goes down so easy, it's only on the subsequent plays that you realize how fully realized and textured it is. A terrific debut that has only grown in stature since its release. -- Stephen Thomas\n Erlewine \n  \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Bluebird [03:29] \n 02.Mighty tight woman [04:20] \n 03.Thank you [02:51] \n 04.Finest lovin' man [04:42] \n 05.Any day woman [02:24] \n 06.Big road [03:31] \n 07.Walking blues [02:40] \n 08.Danger heartbreak dead [02:53] \n ahead \n 09.Since I fell for you [03:06] \n 10.I ain't blue [03:36] \n 11.Women be wise [04:10] \n ____ \n \n 37:42 min \n 48,8 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48e2aec431db81c8ca137e1106efe59b1ecddbf9","amp;dn":"Bonnie_Raitt-Bonnie_Raitt-%28Retail%29-1971-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48e2aec431db81c8ca137e1106efe59b1ecddbf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,226,174,196,49,219,129,200,202,19,126,17,6,239,229,155,30,205,219,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

That, in simple language is extraterritoriality, and in addition to the Americans, the Belgians, Danes, French, British, Italians, Japanese, Dutch, Norwegians, Portugese, Spanish, Swedish, Brazilians, Mexicans and Swiss residents in China, have similar privileges. The Germans, Austrians and Russians, prior to the World War, had similar privileges but lost their rights directly or indirectly as a result of the War.\n\n---\n\nThis is a debate on whether or not extraterritoriality should be abolished in China in the 1920s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19fbbdfdf3b0dd2e9e0a6c387ebebe4bdd40f3f7","amp;dn":"Extraterritoriality+-+The+China+Weekly+Review","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19fbbdfdf3b0dd2e9e0a6c387ebebe4bdd40f3f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,251,189,253,243,176,221,46,158,10,108,56,126,190,190,75,221,64,243,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

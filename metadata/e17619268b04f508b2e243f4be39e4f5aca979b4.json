Charles Mingus consciously designed the six-part ballet as his magnum opus, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ implied in his famous inclusion of liner notes by his psychologist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as much an examination of his own tortured psyche as it is a conceptual piece about love and struggle. It veers between so many emotions that it defies easy encapsulation; for that matter, it can be difficult just to assimilate in the first place. Yet the work soon reveals itself as a masterpiece of rich, multi-layered texture and swirling tonal colors, manipulated with a painterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attention to detail. There are a few stylistic reference points ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ellington, the contemporary avant-garde, several flamenco guitar breaks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but the totality is quite unlike what came before it. Mingus relies heavily on the timbral contrasts between expressively vocal-like muted brass, a rumbling mass of low voices (including tuba and baritone sax), and achingly lyrical upper woodwinds, highlighted by altoist Charlie Mariano. Within that framework, Mingus plays shifting rhythms, moaning dissonances, and multiple lines off one another in the most complex, interlaced fashion heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d ever attempted. Mingus was sometimes pigeonholed as a firebrand, but the personal exorcism of Black Saint deserves the reputation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ one neednÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be able to follow the story line to hear the suffering, mourning, frustration, and caged fury pouring out of the music. The 11-piece group rehearsed the original score during a Village Vanguard engagement, where Mingus allowed the players to mold the music further; in the studio, however, his exacting perfectionism made The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady the first jazz album to rely on overdubbing technology. The result is one of the high-water marks for avant-garde jazz in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢60s and arguably MingusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ most brilliant moment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e17619268b04f508b2e243f4be39e4f5aca979b4","amp;dn":"Charles+Mingus+-+The+Black+Saint+And+The+Sinner+Lady+%5BImpulse%21+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e17619268b04f508b2e243f4be39e4f5aca979b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,118,25,38,139,4,245,8,178,226,67,244,190,57,228,245,172,169,121,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

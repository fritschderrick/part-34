Geddes Gengras and the Raw Power Band, and Peaking Lights In A Dub Style vs Future Times.\n\nIt might be more than 40 years since Lee Perry built an unassuming studio called The Black Ark in the Washington Gardens neighborhood of Kingston, Jamaica, and his brother-in-mind King Tubby worked his magic on a couple of multi-track tapes. But their echoes still resonate to this day. From your favorite woozy indie pop combo to the countless bedroom producers exploring the limits of bass from London to LA, dub still stands as one of the main influences of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dance and pop music. To celebrate this heritage, the Red Bull Music Academy invited some of those artists who carry the torch that Perry and Tubby once ignited to perform in a truly unique setting. Expect double-trouble pairings, heavenly harmonies in surround sound, and mixing board magic live on stage. Acts on the bill include dubwise devastators such as the mighty Adrian Sherwood; JamaicaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest vocal group of all time, The Congos; Maxmillion Dunbar and Protect-UÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Future Times; DIY electronic dubbers Peaking Lights; and none other than his majesty, Lee Ã¢â‚¬ËœScratchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Perry himself.\n\n\nbig up to midnight_raver (midnightraverblog.com) for sharing me the single WAV to this great Lee Perry &amp; Special Guests in SBD quality. added setlist and tracked to FLAC just now.\n\nenjoy,\n\n\n\nchico, reggaetraders.net (RT), 2013/10/03\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://veryrare.org/_ld/1/96810763.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://veryrare.org/_ld/1/96810763.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaea18d0f81075e95e6ac151f73f39a84967cc82","amp;dn":"Lee+Perry+2013-05-30+Poisson+Rouge%2C+NYC%2C+USA+SBD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaea18d0f81075e95e6ac151f73f39a84967cc82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,234,24,208,248,16,117,233,94,106,193,81,247,63,57,168,73,103,204,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

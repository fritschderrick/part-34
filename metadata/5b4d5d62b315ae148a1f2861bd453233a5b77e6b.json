Demiurg was apparently a side-project for some guy, but eventually turned into a full-time production for this album.  This is their second album, following their first &quot;Breath of the Demiurg&quot; which was produced in 2007.\n\nApparently these guys have been in a wide variety of bands, and are combining for the pure satisfaction of making some ungodly Death Metal (Their guitarist has been in too many fucking bands to count).\n\nWhat am I trying to say?  Demiurg is surprisingly phenomenal, from start to finish, with songs that will grind your brain into lumps of unrecognizable mush such as &quot;Cremated Lie the Day&quot; and &quot;World Destroyer&quot;.  These guys are fan-fucking-tastic, my hat truly goes off to them.  Easy 5/5, now download and seed.\n\nDemiurg\n\nThe Hate Chamber - (2008)\n\n1. Resurrecting the Rotting (Flesh Festival pt.II)\n2.

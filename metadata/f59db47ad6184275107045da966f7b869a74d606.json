Good Lovin' Man\n\nDion DiMucci's claim to fame was due to &quot;The Wanderer&quot; and &quot;A Teenager inLove&quot; by Dion &amp; The Belmonts back those sunny doo-wop days of the late 50's and early 60's. Fast forward to the smooth hazy days of the seventies and add 1 Phil Spector, 9 guitarists, 2 basses, 3 drummers, and a orchestra, and we get this forgotten piece of musical history. \n\nHonestly, I'm only into about half of this album but that half, I must say, I am REALLY into. The beginning title track sets the whole feel of the record as the glacial funeral procession tempo parades through all those poor little holes in everyone's heart. Yes, it almost does sound like the ending to every SNL episode but despite the somber mood, it is a gorgeous love song. Almost, a matter of life and death to prove one's love and devotion. A tribute to a eternal bond. Dion's vocals are top-notch, pulsing, cresting between registers all while being carried by that famous Wall of Sound (circa 1970's version). This is totally where J. Spaceman got that Spiritualized dirge from. Too bad he didn't come with the pipes to match.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f59db47ad6184275107045da966f7b869a74d606","amp;dn":"Dion+-+Born+To+Be+With+You+%5B1975%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f59db47ad6184275107045da966f7b869a74d606","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,157,180,122,214,24,66,117,16,112,69,218,150,111,123,134,154,116,214,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

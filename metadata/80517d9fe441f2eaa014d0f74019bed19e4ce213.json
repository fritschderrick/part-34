All except one. Trespassing late at night with criminal intent, fourteen-year-old Eddie Morton sees something he isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t supposed to see - a sinister secret that endangers the life of every child who walks the school corridors in broad daylight; a chilling conspiracy in which even the headmaster may be implicated. Eddie possesses only fragments of the puzzle; he must dig deeper. But where do you turn when you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know who to trust? How do you cope when running away holds the direst consequences? And what do you do when you discover youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re dealing with people who are not really people at all?\n\nepub,mobi and txt.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80517d9fe441f2eaa014d0f74019bed19e4ce213","amp;dn":"Uterior+by+Darryl+Sloan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80517d9fe441f2eaa014d0f74019bed19e4ce213","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,81,125,159,228,65,242,234,160,20,208,247,64,25,190,209,158,76,226,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The tracks are in keeping with her proven record of lyrical beauty and simplicity, with a strong rhythm section and funky keyboards. Some songs are reminiscent of Fleetwood Mac in its heyday, particularly &amp;#039;You Are&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Friend&amp;#039;. This will no doubt please Mac fans who lamented McVie&amp;#039;s absence from the band&amp;#039;s 2003 album &amp;#039;Say You Will&amp;#039;. There is a variety of styles over the album, though, partly acknowledging the singer&amp;#039;s blues roots and including writing contributions from a number of others, among whom are McVie&amp;#039;s nephew Dan Perfect and former Mac guitarist Billy Burnette. Overall, this album will satisfy fans of Christine McVie&amp;#039;s excellent ear for a catchy tune, and allow them once again to hear the beauty of her ageless honeyed vocals.\n\n(Amazon review).sm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aff3806cc9b68680536f6993f93b71994f4f3397","amp;dn":"Christine+McVie+-+In+the+Meantime+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aff3806cc9b68680536f6993f93b71994f4f3397","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,243,128,108,201,182,134,128,83,111,105,147,249,59,113,153,79,79,51,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

She's an ointment of love, with a voice that bedevil, twirl, and enamours. u can either wake up with her, and embrace the lovely day, spend a stormy afternoon with the blues in high, or go to bed with her, her lips in a tune.  Ella, the ultimate dream girl, black blue or white.\n\nI'm really thrilled by this compilation; first of all - it encompasses her golden era ( records were cut from 1956 -1963 ), when her voice was at its strongest and most flexible.   In adittion to that, there's a lot of variety - from more &quot;stringy&quot; arrangements to pure jazz, there's even some blues and the songs are really more than interesting - from her hits ( &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;, &quot;I Loves You Porgy&quot;, &quot;How High the Moon&quot; ) to the songs less often connected to Ella, but marveles nevertheless (Leroy Carr's &quot;In the Evening - when the sun goes down&quot; - my favorite track).\n\nElla is represented here with a variety of orchestras ( arranged by Nelson Riddle, Russ Garcia, Frank DeVol, Paul Weston, Billy May, Marty Paich ), Duke Ellington's magnificent orchestra on one track and various smaller groups - lead by Paul Smith ( + Kessel, Mondragon, Stoller, or + Hall, Midlebrooks, Johnson ), Oscar Peterson ( + Ellis, Brown, Bellson ), on one track ( Berlin's &quot;I'm putting All My Eggs in One Basket&quot; ) with Louis Armstrong.  One track ( In the Evening ) features Roy Eldridge, Wild Bill Davis ( organ ) + Ellis (g), Brown (b), Johnson(dm).\n\nThere are live tracks ( from &quot;Ella in Berlin&quot; ), studio tracks ( from &quot;Ella Swings Brightly&quot;, &quot;Ella F. Sings the Rodgers and Hart Song Book&quot;, &quot;Ella and Louis Again&quot;, &quot;Ella Swings Lightly&quot; ). \n\nVerve Jazz Masters is, in my opinion, one of the best ways to approach jazz.  This CD is, in my equally firm opinion, one of the best ways to approach Ella Fitzgerald. \n\nBTW \n&quot;A-Tisket A-Tasket&quot; is, luckily, given an ironic treatment, with mambo rhythms and Ella's self-parody ~ Nikica Gilic\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 06 - Ella Fitgerald Tracks:\n01  I Hear Music 2:21\n02  I AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Got NothinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ But The Blues 4:42 \n03  EvÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢rything IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Got 3:23 \n04  I Loves You Porgy 4:37 \n05  Mack The Knife 4:46 \n06  IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Putting All My Eggs In One Basket 3:27\n07  The Man That Got Away 5:19 \n08  Just You, Just Me 2:22 \n09  IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Got The World On A String 4:51\n10  A-Tisket A-Tasket 2:22\n11  These Foolish Things 7:38\n12  Heat Wave 2:24 \n13  I Never Had A Chance 2:48\n14  How High The Moon? 7:00 \n15  In The Evening (When The Sun Goes Down) 4:30 \n16  Signing Off 3:47\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:135f7caac5e8001cfb8365c2b30446aec819f2d2","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+06+-+Ella+Fitgerald+%281994%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+160%5D%5Bh3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"135f7caac5e8001cfb8365c2b30446aec819f2d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,95,124,170,197,232,0,28,251,131,101,194,179,4,70,174,200,25,242,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

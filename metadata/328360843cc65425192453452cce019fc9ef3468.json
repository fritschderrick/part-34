It did not for me and froze up my DAW (Ableton Live 8.3) and was it was disabled on restart. Use the .dll file in the Three Plugins folder instead for Specta C2. \n\n\nThis collection was found on a Russian BT site. N\nFind lots of cool stuff in those site but they are not the safest sites in the world but I seem to be having no issues as far as malware or viruses goes. Scanned on my end and all plugins running okay. Nice little collection I have not seen a nearly full collection for yet at the regular sites here. \n\nAs always enjoy. And, please, if you make money with these plugins, remember, who cares. \n\nUranium Willy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:328360843cc65425192453452cce019fc9ef3468","amp;dn":"Crysonic+-+Almost+Everything+Bundle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"328360843cc65425192453452cce019fc9ef3468","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,131,96,132,60,198,84,37,25,36,83,69,44,206,1,159,201,239,52,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Originally, the quality was sub-par with the tracks containing hiss, hum, clicks and pops; from which I assume originated from the recording source. I have done my best to recover the beauty of these with my own re-mastering.\n\n\nThe following is the track listing with unofficial titles:\n\n01. Early Phone Call\n02. Feeling Nostalgic\n03. Zuma Beach\n04. I Need $50,000\n05. Sex At The Loft\n06. Blair And Her Dad\n07. Julian On The Stairs\n08. Going Through Withdrawal\n09. Heading To Palm Springs\n10. Rip's Hotel Suite\n11. The Cemetery (Extended)\n12. Quick Escape\n13. Seeing Blair Again\n14. The Loft's Been Trashed\n15.

They're intended as a sort of diary entry, or short stories, built and completed within a few days to give concise snapshots of his moods via the medium of f*cking mental breakcore. To be totally fair, they're still Venetian Snares tracks and hit like a pickaxe to the temple, regardless of the background. 'Posers And Camera Phones' rinses baroque chiptune melodies and rapid fire, pitchshifting amens, while 'Cadaverous' takes it's title from a sample lifted outta The Wire (if we're not mistaken), and surrounds it with bouncy hardcore thrusts and jungle parries. 'Welfare Wednesday' goes on a happy hardcore mission with distorted ragga chat and 'Ultraviolent Junglist' wrenches out a hyper-synched breakbeats at cardiac arrest tempos. If you're feeling fit enough, have a go.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4f5a89ab077a7480dc1cc2ef4ac7528c6af378d","amp;dn":"Venetian+Snares+-+My+So-Called+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4f5a89ab077a7480dc1cc2ef4ac7528c6af378d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,245,168,154,176,119,167,72,13,193,204,46,244,172,117,40,198,175,55,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

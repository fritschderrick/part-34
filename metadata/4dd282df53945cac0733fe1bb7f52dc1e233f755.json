Some of their songs are hit-or-miss, but several are fantastic, including some I've been unable to find anywhere online, forcing me to buy the CD!  This is their Best Of album from their 1979 - 1989 recordings.  If you haven't heard them before, check out &quot;The Gypsy Laddie&quot; and &quot;Jamie Raeburn's Farewell&quot;, which are my two favorites.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dd282df53945cac0733fe1bb7f52dc1e233f755","amp;dn":"The+Tannahill+Weavers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dd282df53945cac0733fe1bb7f52dc1e233f755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,210,130,223,83,148,92,172,7,51,254,27,183,245,45,193,226,51,247,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

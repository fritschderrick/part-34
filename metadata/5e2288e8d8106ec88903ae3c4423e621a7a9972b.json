The project many times was almost cancelled but was finally launched and the book covers the trials and tribulations of the first 18 months on Mars (Opportunity is still going nearly 10 years later). Provides a first-hand memoir by the PI (principal investigator) Steve Squyres of how it all came to be, and what it takes to launch a space probe and why those landing scenes of people high fiveing and crying are so emotional after many hurdles and close calls.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e2288e8d8106ec88903ae3c4423e621a7a9972b","amp;dn":"Roving+Mars+%28Spirit%2C+Opportunity%2C+Mars%29+%282nd+try%29+-+rip-oop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e2288e8d8106ec88903ae3c4423e621a7a9972b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,34,136,232,216,16,110,200,137,3,174,60,68,35,230,33,167,169,151,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Featuring contributions from Eleanor Bone, Cecil Williamson, Alex &amp; Maxine Sanders [above], Doreen Valiente et al. Very much of its time and with some very rare footage, also includes reference to the famously unsolved murder of Charles Walton on Meon Hill.\n\nThe Power Of The Witch is worth a watch even if you are not particularly interested in the occult - rather watch it as a document of its time, capturing as it does peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attitudes, beliefs, fashions and plummy Brit accents. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a curious mixture of patriarchal stiff upper lip-ism and unerring belief in both Christianity and the forces of magic, making it feel very much as if it comes from a completely different era. Not to mention, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a goldmine of potential witch haus footage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:375260c392bcc367c13688c3a1dd80b7d4e2fa23","amp;dn":"The+Power+of+the+Witch+%281971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"375260c392bcc367c13688c3a1dd80b7d4e2fa23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,82,96,195,146,188,195,103,193,54,136,195,161,221,128,183,212,226,250,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The father, played with comic serenity by Nino Manfredi, has kept track of every last diaper and schoolbook he ever had to buy for his son, and would now like Alberto to pay back a total of more than 30 million lire. He assures his son helpfully that there is no hurry. Alberto need not repay his debt until he himself is ready to have a child.\n\nCut to Alberto (Sergio Castellitto), now grown up and living in Paris, married to a wife named Juliette (Eugenia Marruzzo) who is due to have a baby the next day. A broke, panicky Alberto abandons his sleeping wife and hops aboard a train to Rome, hoping to solve his family problem once and for all.\n\nIf anyone in &quot;Alberto Express&quot; belongs on a train it is Mr. Manfredi, whose performance as a railway employee in &quot;Bread and Chocolate&quot; had all the charm this film sorely lacks. The unappealing Alberto is seen through an endless array of contrived episodes, which supposedly hinge on his efforts to raise money. He meets a rich old man who will pay him to have sex with the man's beautiful young wife. He encounters a former girlfriend (Marie Trintignant) and steals money from her purse. The actresses playing young women who are unaccountably smitten with the nervous, sweaty Alberto all look like interchangeable fashion models, which does little to make the film any funnier or more likely.\n\nJeanne Moreau, giving a pay-the-rent-caliber performance, appears briefly as an aging baroness who has been virtually mummified in her search for eternal youth, and who provides one of the screenplay's typically toothless insights: &quot;The most complicated things always work out in the end.&quot; Even more wince-worthy is the film's presentation of a gay black American tourist who wears a diamond in his front tooth and declares: &quot;Europe is such an exotic continent!&quot;\n\nArthur Joffe's direction is most noteworthy for allowing Mr. Castellitto infinite room for mugging and overreacting, and for bungling the few sight gags that the film attempts. These include a funny-as-a-corpse visit with Alberto's dead ancestors and a scene that shows patrons in the dining car suddenly sporting red antennae, in sympathy with the lobster Alberto is about to eat.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91ab7df7842c1b01e47a49e00f5643e00e4d06a7","amp;dn":"%E5%A4%A2%E5%B9%BB%E5%88%97%E8%BB%8A%2FAlberto+Express%281990%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91ab7df7842c1b01e47a49e00f5643e00e4d06a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,171,125,247,132,44,27,1,228,122,73,224,15,86,67,224,14,77,6,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

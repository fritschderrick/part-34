Battle to battle, readers will see how faster-loading, more accurate rifles changed the battlefield. Readers will also encounter many instances where decisionmakers chose to issue rifles ill-suited for the task at hand when better options were available.\n\nAuthor David Westwood has handled every weapon he describes, from muskets to breechloaders, from repeaters and bolt-action rifles to semiautomatics and self-loaders. His exhaustive research reveals new insights into both the successes and failures of rifled weapons. The result is a fresh look at a common weapon's most uncommon story.\n\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n\n&quot;A glossary, an extensive bibliography, and a competent index make this a must-have item useful for all libraries.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ\n\nAmerican Reference Books Annual\nBook Description\n\nFrom the earliest muskets to the present-day assault rifles, combat rifles have been developed to offer ever-increasing range, accuracy, effectiveness, and ease of use. But the story of the deployment of the infantry rifle is not one of continuous progress. How is it that the weapons on the front lines have too often been neither what the soldiers wanted nor needed?\n\n\n# Publisher \tABC-CLIO (March 1, 2005)\n# Language \tEnglish\n# ISBN-10 \t1851094016\n# ISBN-13 \t978-1851094011\n\nwww.amazon.com/Rifles-Illustrated-History-Weapons-Warfare/dp/1851094016/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372405973&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=rifles+an+illustrated+history+of+their+impact\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/dANNmaAeH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/dANNmaAeH&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12e86f40b9df5293686db376843af6bbf092f2ff","amp;dn":"Rifles%3A+An+Illustrated+History+of+Their+Impact+%28Weapons+and+Warf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12e86f40b9df5293686db376843af6bbf092f2ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,232,111,64,185,223,82,147,104,109,179,118,132,58,246,187,240,146,242,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

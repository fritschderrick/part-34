In other words, how does our innate grasping perceive the self to exist? What does our innate ignorance perceive? What does it grasp at? We should always focus upon our own condition and not point our finger at someone else?s ignorance. Having discovered this, we must then find the means of generating a different kind of perception, one that directly contradicts the mistaken one that grasps at self. This perception is the perfect view of emptiness, or selflessness. However, in order to realize this view, we first have to be clear about what this view actually is. We need to establish the correct view of emptiness.&quot;\n\nIn this book, Venerable Geshe Gyeltsen does indeed help us establish a correct view of emptiness, the ultimate mode of being of all phenomena, which we have to do if we are ever to escape from our beginningless suffering and find the perfect peace and happiness we seek. Basing his explanation of emptiness on The Heart Sutra, the essence of the Buddha?s perfection of wisdom teachings, and the emptiness section of a classic Tibetan thought transformation text, Namkha Pel?s Mind Training Like the Rays of the Sun, Geshe-la compassionately helps us cut through our inability to see reality and sets us firmly on the path to liberation and enlightenment. \n\n(Uploaded through the kind permission of)          &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.lamayeshe.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.lamayeshe.com&lt;/a&gt;\n***********************************************************************************\n*                                                                                 *\n*  *LYWA      *LYWA*      *LYWA* *LYWA   *LYWA   *LYWA    *LYWA   *LYWA*          *\n*   LYWA        LYWA      LYWA    LYWA    LYWA    LYWA     LYWA    *LYWA*         *\n*   LYWA         LYWA    LYWA      LYWA    LYWA  LYWA     LYWA    *L.Y.WA*        *\n*   LYWA          LYWA  LYWA       LYWA     LYWA LYWA     LYWA    LYWALYWA        *\n*   LYWA           LYWALYWA         LYWA    LYWALYWA     LYWA    LYWA  LYWA       *\n*   LYWA            L.Y.WA          LYWA     L.Y.WA      LYWA    LYWA  LYWA       *\n*   LYWA             LYWA            LYWA     LYWA*     LYWA    LYWA    LYWA      *\n*   LYWA             LYWA            LYWA     LYWA*     LYWA    LYWALYWALYWA      *\n*   LYWA             LYWA             LYWA   L.Y.W.A   LYWA    LYWA      LYWA     *\n*   LYWA             LYWA             LYWA  LYWA LYWA *LYWA    LYWA      LYWA     *\n*   LYWA             LYWA              LYWALYWA   LYWALYWA    LYWA        LYWA    *\n*   LYWA             LYWA              L.Y.W.A    L.Y.W.A     LYWA        LYWA    *\n*   LYWA             LYWA               LYWA*      LYWA*     LYWA          LYWA   *\n*  ~LYWA*LYWA*LYWA* ~LYWA~              LYWA       LYWA     ~LYWA~        ~LYWA~  *\n*                                                                                 *\n*      ~LAMA~      *      ~YESHE~       *      ~WISDOM~      *      ~ARCHIVE~     *\n*                                                                                 *\n***********************************************************************************\n\nThe Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive (LYWA) is the collected works of Lama Thubten Yeshe and Kyabje Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche. The Archive was founded in 1996 by Lama Zopa Rinpoche, its spiritual director, to make available in various ways the teachings it contains. Publication of books of edited teachings for free distribution is one of the ways.\n\nPlease visit http://www.lamayeshe.com for HEAPS of Dharma material\n\nLama Yeshe and Lama Zopa Rinpoche began teaching at Kopan Monastery, Nepal, in 1970. Since then, their teachings have been recorded and transcribed. At present we have more than 10,000 hours of digital audio and some 60,000 pages of raw transcript on our computers. Many recordings, mostly teachings by Lama Zopa Rinpoche, remain to be transcribed, and as Rinpoche continues to teach, the number of recordings in the Archive increases accordingly. Most of our transcripts have been neither checked nor edited.\n\nThe Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive is a member of the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition. We are a 501(c)(3) tax-deductible, non-profit corporation dedicated to the welfare of all sentient beings and totally dependent upon your donations for our continued existence.

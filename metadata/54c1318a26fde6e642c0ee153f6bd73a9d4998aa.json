In March of 2006 drummer M joined the band, first as a session member to help out at rehearsals, and then on a full time basis.\n\nIn July of the same year, PROFANE PRAYER entered the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Diagogi KosmiaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ studios to begin recording the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bloodred FullmoonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ demo. Consisting of four songs, the demo was mixed and mastered by Manolis Koutsakis, and was self-released on CD and Tape (limited to 150 copies).\n\nIn October 2008 PROFANE PRAYER finished recording their debut full-length album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eye of SinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The nine-track album was recorded, mixed and mastered at the Basement Studios. Drums were engineered by Mark Cross (Firewind), whilst guitars, vocals and bass were engineered by George Bokos (Rotting Christ, Nightfall). Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eye of SinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was mixed by George Bokos and mastered by Chris Tsoukalas (Basement Studios). Soon after, M and JNK departed from the band, and THC returned to take over the drums once again. The line up was completed by the arrival of Sick Mind (Hordes of Decay) on bass.\n\nIn March of 2009, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Under the Black SunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a track from the debut album featured on TerrorizerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fear Candy: UnsignedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ CD. The same year, the band starts its collaboration with Carpathian ForestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Daniel VrangsinnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Misantrof Antirecords, that re-released the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2006 demo as part of its Music Archives making it available for free download. PROFANE PRAYER also contributed the opening track to the labelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s annual Ã¢â‚¬Å“Holy Fucking AntichristmasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ compilation.\n\nDecember 2010 the band sign a deal with Orkestral Promenade Productions and the release of its debut album is scheduled for early 2011.\n\nOn the 16th of January 2011, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eye of SinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is released through Misantrof Antirecords as a free download and Orkestral Promenade Productions on CD. After successfully supporting Impaled Nazarene in Athens, the band is currently planning a series of shows in Greece and abroad for the promotion of their debut album.

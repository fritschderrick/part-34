By adapting or building boilers and turbines to accept multiple fuel sources, they can be co-fired with biomass and waste derived fuels, allowing a reduction in carbon output, thus providing cleaner energy.\r\n\r\nFuel flexibility is becoming more important in a world of diminishing fossil fuel stocks. Many countries are investing in the development of more efficient fuel flexible boilers and turbines, and their use is becoming more prevalent in industry as well.\r\n\r\nThis book provides comprehensive coverage of flexible fuel energy generation across all potential fuel types, and was written by a selection of experts in the field who discuss the types of fuels which can be used in fuel flexible energy generation, from solid fuels to biomass fuels, the preparation of fuels to be used in fuel flexible operations, that includes their handling and transport, and combustion and conversion technologies with chapters ranging from large-scale coal gasification to technology options and plant design issues","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43769f7f136d5888e4eb962ea6350f5a0e66fcb5","amp;dn":"Fuel+Flexible+Energy+Generation+-+Solid%2C+Liquid+and+Gaseous+Fuel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43769f7f136d5888e4eb962ea6350f5a0e66fcb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,118,159,127,19,109,88,136,228,235,150,46,166,53,15,90,14,102,252,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

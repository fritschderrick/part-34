However, at this point in his career, Martin was in the midst of writing the screenplay for his first starring role in the motion picture, The Jerk. As a result, he spent less of his time working on material for his stand-up career and the album was his first to not make the Top 10 on Billboard's Pop Albums Chart, peaking only at #25. The album was also his first to not go Platinum; it was, however, certified Gold.\nOne track was simply a humorous reading of a short story from his book Cruel Shoes accompanied by a banjo solo in the background. The track &quot;Drop Thumb Medley&quot; is an instrumental banjo performance.\n\n01. Born To Be Wild (Album Version)\t \n02. The All Being (Album Version)\t\n03. McDonald's/ Men's Underwear\n04.

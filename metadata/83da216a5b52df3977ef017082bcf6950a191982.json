Believe it or not, that list is still around. I actually met my wife there. :)\n\nBut back then, Defiant was really something new and different on the newborn, barren wasteland of the internet. A bunch of fans with a similar passion for Star Trek came together and formed close friendships while telling stories about our fictional crew set upon my favorite of all the Star Trek ships, the USS Defiant (of Deep Space Nine fame).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83da216a5b52df3977ef017082bcf6950a191982","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+Defiant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83da216a5b52df3977ef017082bcf6950a191982","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,218,33,106,91,82,223,57,119,239,1,112,130,188,246,149,10,25,25,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

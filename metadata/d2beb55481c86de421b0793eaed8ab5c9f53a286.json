Gastrointestinal pathology\r\nhas developed into such a large and diverse subject\r\nthat it becomes very difficult for a small group of authors\r\nto write the entire book. So, the remaining editors decided\r\nthat, not only should the book become multi-author, but\r\nit should also become international in its authorship. We\r\nmake no excuses for this because we believe this is the best\r\nway for this unique title to survive in the face of much\r\nexcellent competition","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2beb55481c86de421b0793eaed8ab5c9f53a286","amp;dn":"Morson+and+Dawson%27s+Gastrointestinal+Pathology+5th+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2beb55481c86de421b0793eaed8ab5c9f53a286","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,190,181,84,129,200,109,228,33,176,121,62,174,216,171,92,159,83,162,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

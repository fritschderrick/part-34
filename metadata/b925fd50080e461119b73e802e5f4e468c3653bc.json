As an artistic and energetic glitter-loving diva in the making, the 11-year-oldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vivid daydreams about how life should be are often played out as full-blown musical productions. In her mind, Hudson Rivers (David Mazouz), the eighth cutest boy in Mackerel Middle School, returns her affections and Angeline (Sterling Griffith), the prettiest and most popular girl in school, and other perfect people like her, are banished so that average folk get their due. Real life, however, is somewhat different and, as a result, Jamie pours out her innermost thoughts in her cherished diary and shares some of her feelings with her beloved Aunt Carol (Laura Bell Bundy) as well as her shrewd best friend Isabella (Mary-Charles Jones), who may not be the best influence on her.\n\nWhen Mackerel Middle SchoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arts program is threatened because of budget cuts, Assistant Principal Devon (James Waterston) announces the districtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first-ever Jump-a-thon fundraiser. Jamie sees her winning participation as an opportunity to not only save the arts program, but to impress Hudson, and by beating Angeline, bring justice to ordinary people of the world. At the same time, she becomes the unwitting participant in one of IsabellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s schemes and her diary goes missing. As the story progresses, Jamie recognizes the importance of doing the right thing, learns not to judge by appearances and puts aside personal feelings for the greater good. She also discovers her own sparkling inner beauty, which was there all along. Does Jamie's beloved diary land in the wrong hands, or is she able to get her prized possession back unscathed?\n\n\nCast: \n\nEmily Alyn Lind  ...  Jamie Kelly  \n\nSterling Griffith  ...

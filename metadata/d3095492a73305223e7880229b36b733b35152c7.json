Lawrence has never been among the most adventurous country \n singers and of all the post-Garth Brooks new traditionalists, he often avoids honky tonk grit, even though he has a nice twang in his voice that would work well on rowdier material. Nevertheless, Strong still ranks among his smoothest albums, a record dominated by ballads and where up-tempo songs are as polished as the slow \n ones. Not that this is a bad thing, since Lawrence does this kind of music well. \n There isn't as much musical variety as there is on a Kenny Chesney record, as it is divided between earnest heartache ballads, anthemic mid-tempo numbers, and the \n occasional mildly rock up-tempo tune. A few of these songs stand out -- the \n sentimental single &quot;Paint Me a Birmingham,&quot; the honky tonk dance of &quot;Sawdust on Her Halo,&quot; the gently insistent opener &quot;It's All How You Look at It&quot; -- but more than anything, this album is of a piece, a collection of professionally crafted, no-frills modern country with an adult contemporary bent. While it doesn't stand apart from the pack, either from Lawrence's other albums or those of his peers, it's a sturdy  record, sure to satisfy anyone who's enjoyed his other albums. -- Stephen Thomas \n Erlewine \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.It's all how you look at it [03:04] \n 02.Strong [04:31] \n 03.Stones [03:55] \n 04.Paint me A birmingham [03:48] \n 05.Everywhere but hollywood [03:08] \n 06.A far cry from you [03:50] \n 07.Bobby darwin's daughter [04:18] \n 08.What the flames feel like [03:33] \n 09.Sawdust on her halo [03:15] \n 10.When daddy was A strong man [04:01] \n 11.Think of me [04:13] \n 12.The questionnaire [03:41] \n ____ \n \n 45:17 min \n 64,4 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3095492a73305223e7880229b36b733b35152c7","amp;dn":"Tracy_Lawrence-Strong-%28Retail%29-2004-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3095492a73305223e7880229b36b733b35152c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,9,84,146,167,51,5,34,62,120,128,34,155,54,183,51,179,81,82,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

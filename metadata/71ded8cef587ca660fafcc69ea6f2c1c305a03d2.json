The namesake teenagers have exaggerated wealth, and face stereotypical teenage concerns. They represent a variety of European backgrounds. There are sixty-five episodes all in one season, each thirty minutes long. The original title song was performed in both the English and French versions by ValÃƒÂ©rie Barouille. The show originally aired in first-run syndication in the United States.\n\nIn 1989, Beverly Hills Teens was nominated for the Young Artist award for Best Animated Series.[citation needed] In the same year, the show was syndicated by Claster Television as part of a package featuring Maxie's World (the &quot;lead&quot; program) and the non-DIC series It's Punky Brewster.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71ded8cef587ca660fafcc69ea6f2c1c305a03d2","amp;dn":"Beverly+hills+Teens+DVDRip+32%2F32","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71ded8cef587ca660fafcc69ea6f2c1c305a03d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,222,216,206,245,135,202,102,15,175,204,105,234,111,44,28,48,90,3,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

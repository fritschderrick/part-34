This release contains synced english subtitles\nfor the alien speaking segments.\n\nPretty much the same work done to this one as on Sherlock Holmes, this time I didn't the hardcoded\nenglish subtitles though. Started off by running a few little tweaks over this, to touch up the\nvideo, I ran a heavy denoise filter to get rid of a large amount of noise. Once that was done I\ntook it down to x264. Subtitles were taken from the TS .srt file I had, originally from Dank I think\nso thanks for that, took a good 30 - 60 minutes to sync them but got there in the end and then added\nthem as a default track to the video. Won't go on any longer as i'm very tired. Enjoy!\n\n[img]http://img840.imageshack.us/img840/3395/vlcsnap2012041017h56m56.png[/img]\n[img]http://img571.imageshack.us/img571/6220/vlcsnap2012041018h00m26.png[/img]\n[img]http://img198.imageshack.us/img198/5257/vlcsnap2012041017h57m23.png[/img]\n[img]http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/4739/vlcsnap2012041018h06m26.png[/img]\n[img]http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/7514/vlcsnap2012041018h02m02.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dfd3bf90672c4e2472fd024bc78aa776101cffb","amp;dn":"John+Carter+2012++R6+V2++READNFO+x264+AC3-BBnRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dfd3bf90672c4e2472fd024bc78aa776101cffb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,253,59,249,6,114,196,226,71,47,208,36,188,120,170,119,97,1,207,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

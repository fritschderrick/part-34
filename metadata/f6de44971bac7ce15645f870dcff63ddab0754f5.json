Incorporating the field notes of earlier biographers, along with decades of research in multiple manuscript archives and long-neglected newspapers, this remarkable work will both alter and reinforce current understanding of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sixteenth president.\n\nVolume 1 covers LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s early childhood, his experiences as a farm boy in Indiana and Illinois, his legal training, and the political ambition that led to a term in Congress in the 1840s. In volume 2, Burlingame examines LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life during his presidency and the Civil War, narrating in fascinating detail the crisis over Fort Sumter and LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own battles with relentless office seekers, hostile newspaper editors, and incompetent field commanders. Burlingame also offers new interpretations of LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s private life, discussing his marriage to Mary Todd and the untimely deaths of two sons to disease.\n\nBut through it allÃ¢â‚¬â€his difficult childhood, his contentious political career, a fratricidal war, and tragic personal lossesÃ¢â‚¬â€Lincoln preserved a keen sense of humor and acquired a psychological maturity that proved to be the NorthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most valuable asset in winning the Civil War.\n\nPublished to coincide with the 200th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, this landmark publication establishes Burlingame as the most assiduous Lincoln biographer of recent memory and brings Lincoln alive to modern readers as never before.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6de44971bac7ce15645f870dcff63ddab0754f5","amp;dn":"Abraham+Lincoln+-+A+Life+%28Vol+1%29+-+Michael+Burlingame.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6de44971bac7ce15645f870dcff63ddab0754f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,222,68,151,27,172,124,225,86,69,248,112,220,255,99,221,171,7,84,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

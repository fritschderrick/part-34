Educate your friends for Christmas with POtHS.\n\nDescription:\n\nWilliam Cooper - Germ Theory with Alex Loglia:\nAn eye-opening series on the Germ Theory with Alex Loglia (special HOTT guest), the truth about germs and what AIDS and HIV really are, Vaccines and Cancers...  The truth is MUCH scarier than fiction. Find out more in this well-researched and documented evidence presented on The Hour of the Time broadcast special in 4 parts.\n\nI'd like to share this here, if I may, for those who have the attention span to appreciate it. In this 1993 Bill Cooper 'Hour of the Time' broadcast, Alex Loglia tackles the issue of vaccinations, and notes how so much of the data regarding their efficacy has been due not to any proven disease-prevention technology, but rather to things like reclassification of the same diseases under different names, and purposely-altered guidelines for diagnoses upon the introduction of universal inoculation into a population.\n\nFor those who wish to venture even farther down the rabbit hole, I would recommend looking into the Germ Theory of Disease itself presented in this video series.  The latter gets into the pleomorphic nature of bacteria and other microorganisms, and revisits the theories (and public and scientific acceptance) of Louis Pasteur, along with competing theories of such notable figures as BÃƒÂ©champ, who insisted that germs no more cause disease than roadkill causes vultures, and who opened a window into a 'microverse' so incredible that it threatened to upset the scientific/pharmaceutical paradigms.\n\nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long. (I have 4 year old active seeds out there, must be working for some folks!)\n\nEphesians 5:11\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f2381cfae3d45168e1078b7d79a6b461fc2b954","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+SIN-ister+Secrets+-+103+-+The+Germ+Theory+FRAUD+and+Deat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f2381cfae3d45168e1078b7d79a6b461fc2b954","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,35,129,207,174,61,69,22,142,16,120,183,215,154,107,70,31,194,185,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

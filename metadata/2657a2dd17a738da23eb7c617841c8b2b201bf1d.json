Scotland have lost the last 17 meetings since a 25-all draw at Murrayfield in 1983, and the All Blacks scored more than 50 points in the most recent encounter two years ago. The hosts will again start as considerable underdogs but can expect to be galvanised by having a new coach, Vern Cotter. John Inverdale presents, with former international captains Andy Nicol and Keith Wood among the studio guests. Andrew Cotter, Brian Moore and Chris Paterson provide the commentary.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize__: 9.65 GB\nRuntime___: 148 min\nContainer_: TS\nVideo_____: h264 CABAC High L4.0 1920x1080i 25fps ~8224Kbps\nAudio#1___: AC3 192Kbps CBR 2ch 48KHz\nAudio#2___: MP2 256Kbps CBR 2ch 48KHz\n\nDropbox folder\nt i n y u r l . c o m / m s z 9 q 9 a","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2657a2dd17a738da23eb7c617841c8b2b201bf1d","amp;dn":"BBC.Rugby.Union.2014.11.15.Scotland.v.New.Zealand.1080ip.h264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2657a2dd17a738da23eb7c617841c8b2b201bf1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,87,162,221,23,167,56,218,35,235,124,97,120,65,200,178,178,1,191,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

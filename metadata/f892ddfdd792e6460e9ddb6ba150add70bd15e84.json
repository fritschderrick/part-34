Indeed, you are not listening to anything.  You are on the musical equivalent of a magic carpet, with the world as just so much stardust, and time no longer a relevant concept. \n\nThis CD compilation is definitive Bossa Nova.  You will probably never experience music which blends rhythm, harmony, and melody as well as what you'll find here.  Getz's sax is absolutely incredible.  ~ Demosthenes Reborn\n\nThis is not an album, and as such it is not the definitive Bossanova statement.  However, it is the best disc for exploring the genre. \nThe collaboration between Getz and Jobim was magical.  Latin beats fused with jazz rhythms aren't revolutionary in 2001, but this was groundbreaking stuff in the early 60s.  What's more the music sounds as fresh as ever. \n\nAstrud Gilberto had no musical experience prior to the Getz/Jobim/Gilberto experiment, and it's a good thing that they let her sing.  Her voice is sublime, and the live version of &quot;The Girl From Ipanema&quot; which is presented here is perfect.  This CD strikes a nice balance between vocal and instrumental tracks to give a great overview of the genre, one of the most influential in modern music.  ~ nowhereman\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 53 - Stan Getz Tracks:\n01  Corcovado (Quiet Nights Of Quiet Stars) 2:31\n02  Menina Moca 5:42\n03  SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ DanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§o Samba 3:39\n04  Manha De Carnaval (Morning Of Carnival) 5:50\n05  Voce E Eu 3:28\n06  Samba De Uma Nota So 6:13\n07  Doralice 2:47\n08  Insensatez (How Insensitive) 3:23\n09  Chega De Saudade (No More Blues) 4:16\n10  Only Trust Your Heart 4:27\n11  O Grande Amor 4:44\n12  Winter Moon 5:19\n13  Menina Flor 4:11\n14  Samba Triste 4:48\n15  Desafinado 4:14\n16  The Girl From Ipanema 6:30\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f892ddfdd792e6460e9ddb6ba150add70bd15e84","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+53+-+Stan+Getz+%281996%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+160%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f892ddfdd792e6460e9ddb6ba150add70bd15e84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,146,221,253,215,146,230,70,14,157,219,107,161,80,173,215,11,209,94,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

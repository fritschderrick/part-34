She tries to feed and rehouse the people she evicts, and gets the attention of the Monk Foundation. Anjelica Monk tries to get Margo to work for the Foundation, then sends Joe Christmas to seduce Margot to the same end. Monk doesn't really want to fight poverty, though. He wants to tear down a substantial part of Spanish Harlem for a sports palace and housing for the rich. Joe Christmas has some success, but seems to be falling for Margot. Anjelica tries to kill him, but doesn't quite succeed, and he warns Margot. The two women fight on a rooftop, and Anjelica falls. Joe moves away.\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca07ec42e139fbb44147908477b5ab6fdd4d2368","amp;dn":"Margot+-+In+Badtown+%28Heavy+Metal%29+%281991%29+cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca07ec42e139fbb44147908477b5ab6fdd4d2368","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,7,236,66,225,57,251,180,65,71,144,132,119,181,171,111,221,77,35,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

According to Kane, who sings in Spanish, English and French, Pacifika &quot;is simply the Latin way of saying 'peaceful' in the feminine, except that we changed the 'c' to a 'k'.&quot; The group has released 4 albums; their independent debut Unveiled (2004), and three with Six Degrees Records: AsunciÃƒÂ³n (2008), Supermagique (2010) and Amor Planeta (2014).\n\nThe album -----\nTake a Peruvian chanteuse, throw in a duo with a taste for rock and folk music, and give it a moody electronic sound, and you have Pacifika, the Vancouver band that is doing its best to expand the Spanish-language genre outside the realm of world music.\nSurprising in its soul and seductiveness, &quot;Asuncion&quot; beautifully mixes the rhythmic vocals of former pop princess Silvana Kane with the alt music stylings of Adam Popowitz and Toby Peter. Tracks such as &quot;Paloma&quot; and &quot;Estrella De Miel&quot; hint at the diva's roots, much of the album is solidly planted in downtempo electronica.\nEach member of the trio is given the opportunity to explore their musical tastes, whether it be Latin, electronica, '80 new wave or classic rock, the end result easily quantifiable as trip-hop. First track &quot;Sol&quot; sets the seductive mood; &quot;Sweet,&quot; the only English-language track on the disc, offers shades of Zero 7 in its mellow tempo. &quot;Mas y Mas&quot; gives guitarist Popowitz a chance to shine with heady, slow riffs. While ripe for airwaves, its fate is likely limited to abstract music aficionados or special interest music shows on indie radio stations.\n- Erin Maxwell\n\nSuggestions: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.ca/Asuncion-Pacifika/dp/B0013DI4FG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.ca/Asuncion-Pacifika/dp/B0013DI4FG&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifika&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifika&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/asunci%C3%B3n-mw0000752058&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/asunci%C3%B3n-mw0000752058&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://voir.ca/fiches/cd/pacifika-asuncion/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://voir.ca/fiches/cd/pacifika-asuncion/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d238bf8de5f4bc4d2ba70a668672bc654d8a89d","amp;dn":"Pacifika+-+Asuncion+%282008%29+192K+CD+rip+%26gt%3BQG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d238bf8de5f4bc4d2ba70a668672bc654d8a89d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,35,139,248,222,95,75,196,210,186,112,166,104,103,43,198,84,216,168,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Or running barefoot through Bandera's Purple Cow, where her mother tended bar as &quot;Whiskey River&quot; and &quot;Rolling with the Flow&quot; played for the millionth time on the jukebox. &quot;Where I come from, music was always thereÃ¢â‚¬Â¦my father told me that they set up my crib at Floores Country Store so that they could see Willie Nelson play.&quot;\nTeaching herself play the guitar at age 15, Robyn's influences were far beyond her years (Jackson Browne, Van Morrison, Emmylou Harris) listening to albums already 20 years old. As a teenager, she was slipping off to Live Music Capital Austin, Texas every weekend to hear music. Inevitably, Robyn moved to Austin immediately after high school and soon married Austin bassist John Ludwick.\nJust after she and husband John had their first child, and felt their road had been paved, a set of intense life changes woke RobynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sleeping songwriter at age 30. &quot;It just pretty much poured out at that point. I guess it was time, you know.&quot; Robyn dove headlong into her craft, taking on a music career that she feared would be overshadowed by the wealth of family talent that came before her (older brothers Charlie and Bruce Robison and in-laws Kelly Willis and Dixie Chick Emily Robison).\n\nThe critics also agreed that it was time, as LudwickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2005 debut For So Long, produced by Danny Barnes (Dave Mathews), was named a top 10 album of the year by both the Austin Chronicle, and renowned Austin public radio station 90.5 KUT-FM. It went to No. 1 on the Euro-Americana Music Chart and earned her a raved-about No Depression SXSW showcase and a slot at the Austin City Limits Music Festival. \n\nEver since, Robyn has set her mark on the map of great Americana songwriting. Her music and story-telling has been called Ã¢â‚¬Å“The best of Americana and better yet the Best of TexasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. \n\nRobynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2011 album, Out of these Blues, features a dizzying cast, including Producer/Multi-Instrumentalist Gurf Morlix (Lucinda Williams), Ian Ã¢â‚¬Å“MacÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ MacLagan (Rolling Stones), and Gene Elders (George Strait, Lyle Lovett). \n\nCritically acclaimed Out of these Blues, received numerous accolades including Top 10 Album honors from Austin City Limits, No Depression, Texas Music Magazine and 93.3 KGSR as well as Best Album of the year by the Texas Music Scene, No DepressionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Best Female Musicians and nominations for Best Female Vocalist and Best Singer-Songwriter-Folk at the Lone Star Music Awards.\n\nRecently called the Ã¢â‚¬Å“most formidableÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ writer of the RobisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, RobynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music and story-telling has been called Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Best of Americana and the Best of TexasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Robyn's songs have been covered on recent releases by brothers Charlie Robison (HighLife, 2013) and Bruce Robison &amp; Kelly Willis (Our Year, 2014).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfe7f2a32b52c9cf7e7d26fe66792c629924ae42","amp;dn":"Robyn+Ludwick+-+Little+Rain+%5B2014%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfe7f2a32b52c9cf7e7d26fe66792c629924ae42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,231,242,163,43,82,201,207,126,125,38,254,102,121,44,98,153,36,174,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

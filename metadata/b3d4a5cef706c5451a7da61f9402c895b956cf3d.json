Her power, confidence and ability to rock the house are quite evident in the first two explosive tracks of Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Want It.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ After listening to those tracks, I was beginning to think that the CD title wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just a title but a mission statement for Laos. They definitely sound like, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthey WANT ITÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and are more than capable of getting it.\n\n\n\nSo the question is why didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t they get it. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Want ItÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Laos is a re-release of an early 90Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s CD with bonus tracks. From the little bit of investigating that I did, I found out that the band disbanded and now Gudrun Laos (who the band was named after, not the country) was last heard singing in a band called Barfly in 1997. Most of the references mention that Gudrun has one the most unique female rocker voices in the business. Yet, she seems to have disappeared. Well with the re-issue of the CD from MTM records, I hope that new and revived interest in Laos will cause Gudrun to come out of hiding and rock this world the way Ã¢â‚¬ËœWe Want it!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ \n\n\n\nIf you get a chance, this CD should definitely be an addition to anyone with an AOR music collection. GudrunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocals are really out of this world, with the added bonus that she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sing with a German accent.\n\nBand Lineup:\n\n\n\n    Gudrun Laos - vocals\n\n    Ralf Hansmeyer - guitar\n\n    Frank Fricke - guitar\n\n    Thomas RÃƒÂ¶ben - bass\n\n    Wolfgang Schindler - keyboards\n\n    JÃƒÂ¶rg Michael - drums\n\n\n\n\tTrack Listing:\n\n\n\n    I Want it\n\n    Why Is A Good Love\n\n    Now That ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Over\n\n    Straight To The Top\n\n    Jericho\n\n    Heartbreak Road\n\n    We Called It Love\n\n    Long Shot\n\n    Badlands\n\n    Higher Ground\n\n    One More Night\n\n    Bonus Tracks:\n\n    More Than A Feeling\n\n    Come Tomorrow\n\n    Love Sweet Love\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rockeyez.com/reviews/cd/laos/rev-wewantit.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rockeyez.com/reviews/cd/laos/rev-wewantit.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3d4a5cef706c5451a7da61f9402c895b956cf3d","amp;dn":"Laos+-+1990+-+We+Want+It+%28remastered+2005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3d4a5cef706c5451a7da61f9402c895b956cf3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,212,165,206,247,6,197,69,26,125,166,31,148,2,200,149,185,86,207,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

What are these recurring principles and techniques? The answer to this question is the basis of this book. \n\nThe book's four chapters include: (1) Basic Numeracy Ingredients, (2) Wonderful Math Recipes, (3) Favorite Numeracy Dishes, and (4) Special Math Garnishments. Thirty principles of math summarize the common themes behind classic math problems and each problem is rated according to a three-tier system ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ one chili (mild), two chilies (hot), and three chilies (very hot).\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:febddf54b1699e594f71abb1a6cc3f51dadbe45a","amp;dn":"The+Little+Green+Math+Book%3A+30+Powerful+Principles+for+Building+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"febddf54b1699e594f71abb1a6cc3f51dadbe45a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,189,223,84,177,105,158,89,79,113,171,177,166,204,63,81,218,219,228,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

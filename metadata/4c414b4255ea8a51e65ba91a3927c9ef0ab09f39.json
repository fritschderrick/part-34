It works perfectly on my Nook Second Edition Touch with E-Ink and I don't think there should be any problem trying to read it with other E-Readers(Keep in mind that in the more advanced days the program listings get very long so they'll start occupying several lines, most of that can be fixed by choosing a smaller letter size). If you do find problems, however, please let me know and I'll upload the .odt document so you can convert it yourself specifically for your E-Reader.\n\nI hope this is useful.\n\nKeep sharing, keep caring.\n\nPS: I do not own the copyright for this book or take any credit in its making.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c414b4255ea8a51e65ba91a3927c9ef0ab09f39","amp;dn":"Teach+Yourself+C+%2B%2B+in+21+Days+Epub+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c414b4255ea8a51e65ba91a3927c9ef0ab09f39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,65,75,66,85,234,138,81,230,91,169,26,57,39,201,239,10,176,159,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

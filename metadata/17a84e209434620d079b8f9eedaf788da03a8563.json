In the special package of his best Patriotic songs, Charlie has hand-picked his classic renditions and added two new tracks &quot;Iraq Blues&quot; and an updated 2010 version of &quot;(What This World Needs Is) A Few More Rednecks!&quot;\n\nAllmusic Review:\nRounding up patriotic cuts, the Charlie Daniels Band has recorded for Koch over the past decade or so -- mainly re-recordings of standards or older CDB hits, such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSimple ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStill in Saigon,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ although it also has the rabble-rousing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t No Rag, ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a FlagÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from the early days of the Iraq war, all culled from his 2003 album Freedom and Justice for All -- The Land That I Love also adds the brand-new, self-explanatory ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIraq Blues,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ along with a remake of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ(What the World Needs Is) A Few More RednecksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for good measure. This may not be a great enticement for the fan who already owns everything featured here, but it surely adds a bit of modern patriotic fervor to a collection designed for the reddest of the red states. The remakes arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t as good as the originals -- and the recitations are quite heavy-handed -- but The Land That I Love delivers what it promises, no more and no less.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17a84e209434620d079b8f9eedaf788da03a8563","amp;dn":"The+Charlie+Daniels+Band+-+Land+That+I+Love","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17a84e209434620d079b8f9eedaf788da03a8563","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,168,78,32,148,52,98,13,7,155,143,158,237,175,120,141,160,58,133,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

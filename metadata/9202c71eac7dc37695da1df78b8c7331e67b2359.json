Kindly help by giving feedback.\n\nCrookbond is one of my favourite characters from manoj Comics. Crookbond is double secret agent and the chela of James bond. Crookbond along with his brother Motu and father Dhamaka singh who is a police constable fight crime. Crookbond comics were funny and filled with a strange action. Though he was shown as a clumpsy guy who relied on luck more than his brain, but later he started showing his intelligent skills and strength in fighting crime. Motu though being the sidekick was good at using his hands as well.\n\nCrookbond looks very lean and thin, but using his agility and wisdom he was successful in his missions. He was a scientist and good at makeups as well. He carried some of his strange inventions with him during his mission. Most interesting was be his car (named &quot;Super Car&quot;), which had wonderful capabilities. He had a pet dog (Manmauji) that accompanied him in some of his missions.\n\nCrookbond was one of the early popular heroes in Manoj Comics. Manoj comics main heroes list included Crookbond in top 5. However due to Due to changing tastes, Manoj Comics were finally closed down. The only way to appreciate this wonderful character and to keep it alive is to distribute on electronic media. Hope you all enjoy the collection.\n\nMichael Robert.....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9202c71eac7dc37695da1df78b8c7331e67b2359","amp;dn":"Crookbond+Comics+Collection+by+Michael+Robert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9202c71eac7dc37695da1df78b8c7331e67b2359","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,2,199,30,172,125,195,118,149,218,29,247,139,140,115,49,230,123,35,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Filmed in cooperation with the Los Angeles County          \n    Coroner's Office and UCLA Medical Center, AUTOPSY sheds some             \n    interesting light on how taboo autopsies have become and how valuable    \n    they can be medically in addition to showing uncut and extremely         \n    candid footage of actual autopsies, which in many cases are              \n    emotionally draining. Perhaps the most moving sections of the film       \n    are the interviews with the pathologists themselves, who explain the     \n    toll their job takes on their psyche and their families. A revealing     \n    and often disturbing look at a side of modern medicine that many         \n    would prefer to gloss over, AUTOPSY is an amazing and invaluable         \n    account of a world few have seen.                                        \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?

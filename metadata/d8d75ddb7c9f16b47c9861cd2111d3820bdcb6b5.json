The brief and ethereal &quot;Breathe, It's Over&quot; starts things out on an ambient/orchestral note, providing a nice introduction to the similarly hopeful (and sonically spacious) title cut, which posits passionately, if not a bit brusquely, &quot;We feel high as fuck/And everything is good/Good to go&quot; with a soft yet immediate cadence amidst a nest of chiming, clean electric guitars lines that bring to mind Disintegration-era Cure. Despite being hit by a lightning bolt of hope, Sway's first single &quot;Bleed Out&quot; canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let go of the past, preferring to revel in the clichÃƒÂ©s of self-pity (&quot;I gave it all but you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop taking from me&quot;) and anger (&quot;DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you take this moment away from me&quot;) that plagued the band's previous outing -- even the melody sounds cribbed from some other midtempo, radio-ready butane ballad. The band doesn't always fall back on bad habits though, as evidenced by cuts like the pleasant, electro-tinged &quot;Light You Up,&quot; the grungy, propulsive, and genuinely fun &quot;Hard Candy,&quot; and the elegiac instrumental closer &quot;To Be,&quot; resulting in what (at this point) represents their most accessible, immediate, and growth-oriented collection of songs date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8d75ddb7c9f16b47c9861cd2111d3820bdcb6b5","amp;dn":"Blue+October+-+Sway+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8d75ddb7c9f16b47c9861cd2111d3820bdcb6b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,215,93,219,124,159,22,180,124,152,97,205,33,17,211,130,11,220,182,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

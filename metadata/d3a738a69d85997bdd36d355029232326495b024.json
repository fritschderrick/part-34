This minimizes the costs incurred when student pilots are washed out later in the training process.\n\nSome 27 different military customers have already bought 880 SF-260 in all variants. Recently the Italian Air Force ordered its fourth batch of thirty SF-260EA, with an avionics configuration tailored to its specifications. The aircraft is also a favourite of civil professional flying schools.\n\nThe SF-260 is a fully-aerobatic, two seater, side-by-side propeller-driven trainer, with additional third seat to expand its flexibility in non-aerobatic missions. It is available in both piston-engined and turboprop variants, respectively powered by a 260 hp Lycoming AEIO-540 (SF-260E) or a 350 shp Rolls-Royce/Allison Model 250 B-17D turboprop (SF-260TP).\n\nThe worldwide SF-260 fleet has accumulated over 1,800,000 flight hours. \n\nUn peu de culture pour ces connards d&amp;#039;anglophone !\n\nPost if you enjoyed it !\nBonsoir les trolls et les mangeur de gouda !\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3a738a69d85997bdd36d355029232326495b024","amp;dn":"FS2004+FS9%3AReal+Air++SF260","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3a738a69d85997bdd36d355029232326495b024","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,167,56,166,157,133,153,123,221,54,211,85,2,146,50,50,100,149,176,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

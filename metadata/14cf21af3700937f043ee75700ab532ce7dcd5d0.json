But submerged beneath the waves near the Japanese island of Yonaguni is evidence that may well overturn that long-held theory.\n\n\nA small but persuasive number of scholars and scientists have long thought that &quot;advanced&quot; societies may have existed as long as 10,000 years ago. Their theories, however well reasoned and defended, have been hamstrung by a lack of evidence. But recent discoveries of man-made artifacts on the Pacific seafloor may well prove to be the smoking gun that will propel this alternative view of civilization to prominence. HISTORY'S MYSTERIES travels to the site and plunges beneath the waves to examine the discovery, and talks to the investigators who are trying to unearth the secrets it holds.\n\n\nThe answers remain unknown, but the questions themselves may forever change some of the most basic assumptions about our past. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: David Ackroyd\n==========================\n\n\nDirected by: Richard L.Schmidt\n==============================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Japans Mysterious Pyramids\nYear.................:    2001\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:40:35\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3)\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    4:3\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    720x528\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    3003 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    871 MB\nFPS..................:    30.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2001\n\n\n\n\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1739485/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1739485/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14cf21af3700937f043ee75700ab532ce7dcd5d0","amp;dn":"Japans+Mysterious+Pyramids-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14cf21af3700937f043ee75700ab532ce7dcd5d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,207,33,175,55,0,147,127,4,62,231,87,0,171,83,44,231,220,213,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

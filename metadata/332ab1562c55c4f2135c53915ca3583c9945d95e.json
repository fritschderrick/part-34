On his intensely anticipated LP Amma, he ambitiously takes Africa as his muse and source. To his credit, Moreno approached the subject with loads of intellectual curiosity and sensitivity to the vast continentâ€™s diverse cultures. He began this project with extensive research into not only the music, but also the history and current geo-politics of Africa â€“ all of which inform this project.\r\n\r\n A lot of the sounds Moreno chose are West African, echoing Sub-Saharan instruments such as the kalimba. The beats and rhythmic patterns celebrate and draw inspiration from the exquisitely complex yet organic indigenous musical styles of West Africa, â€œShamaâ€ being a particularly euphoric and clear example. Real percussion samples and traditional African vocal chops add luxuriant depth and richness to the albumâ€™s sound.\r\n\r\n ...\r\n\r\n That such a conceptual statement seems completely natural for him demonstrates the expressiveness of his style and his sure-footedness as a producer. If anything, his sound now seems fully realized here. Amma is an astonishing debut LP. Those who have been following his work should find it very satisfying â€“ yet it also makes you long to know where heâ€™ll take his sound next","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:332ab1562c55c4f2135c53915ca3583c9945d95e","amp;dn":"beGun+-+Amma+%282016%29+LP+Album+%40+MP3+%2F+Electronica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"332ab1562c55c4f2135c53915ca3583c9945d95e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,42,177,86,44,85,196,242,19,92,83,145,92,163,88,60,153,69,217,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

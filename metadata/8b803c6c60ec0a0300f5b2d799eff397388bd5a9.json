Heartbreaker\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nA very heavy and overall, good performance. Plant apologise for the last concert they played in Vanvouver two years ago, and he said: &quot;Last night it was quite a peculiar show actually. Something strange happened to me that evening. I found the light show to be amazing and I wondered what the name of the group was!&quot; No Quarter is absolutely beautiful and Dazed And Confused rocks really hard and is led by Jimmy's amazing guitar prowess. Stairway To Heaven really lifts off during the guitar solo and the heavily improvised and dynamic encores close out this really heavy, powerful and exciting show, which in itself would prove to be nothing compared to the next night! Listen to the Whole Lotta Love encore for Lickin' Stick followed by the riffs from Ozone Baby, three years before it's recording! as on the previous night, the band members are in glorious humours and that caused of few very funny introductions. (Bonham was introduced as &quot;a man who's a stinking rotten dirty pig!&quot;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b803c6c60ec0a0300f5b2d799eff397388bd5a9","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1975.03.20+Vancouver%2C+Canada+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b803c6c60ec0a0300f5b2d799eff397388bd5a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,128,60,108,96,236,10,3,0,245,178,215,153,239,243,151,56,139,213,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

But when Zeenie's vivacious cousin enters their household as a &quot;hired girl&quot;, Ethan finds himself obsessed with her and with the possibilities for happiness she comes to represent.\n\nIn one of American fiction's finest and most intense narratives, Edith Wharton moves this ill-starred trio toward their tragic destinies. Different in both tone and theme from Wharton's other works, Ethan Frome has become perhaps her most enduring and most widely read novel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73fd2e9689b689f9cbda543ae0e330fc0dd7a35c","amp;dn":"Edith+Wharton%2C+Ethan+Frome+mobi+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73fd2e9689b689f9cbda543ae0e330fc0dd7a35c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,253,46,150,137,182,137,249,203,218,84,58,224,227,48,252,13,215,163,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

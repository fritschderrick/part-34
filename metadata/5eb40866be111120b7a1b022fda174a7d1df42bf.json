The difficulty of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“translatingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ science highlights one of the incongruities between scientists and the public in society today: the general public claims interest in science and science news, despite having only a tenuous understanding of basic science concepts, while scientists, although generally eager to share knowledge, resent oversimplification and fear misrepresentation in the popularization of their work. In this article, I address the extent of the scientistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s responsibility to enhance scientific understanding of the public, and attempt to reconcile an understanding of what the public needs or desires from scientists with what researchers are actually trained to do.\n\nKEY WORDS: Science literacy Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Science communication Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Science journalism Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Graduate education","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eb40866be111120b7a1b022fda174a7d1df42bf","amp;dn":"Knowledge+is+power%3A+In+a+world+shaped+by+science%2C+what+obligatio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eb40866be111120b7a1b022fda174a7d1df42bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,180,8,102,190,17,17,32,183,161,176,34,253,161,116,167,209,223,66,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

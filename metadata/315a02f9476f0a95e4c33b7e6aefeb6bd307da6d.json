The film was directed by Mathieu Kassovitz and stars Vin Diesel. It was released on 29 August 2008 in the United States.\n\nn 2058, a mercenary named Toorop (Vin Diesel) accepts a contract from a Russian mobster, Gorsky (GÃƒÂ©rard Depardieu), who instructs him to bring a young woman known only as Aurora (MÃƒÂ©lanie Thierry) to New York City. In order to reach this goal, Gorsky gives Toorop a variety of weapons as well as a UN passport that has to be injected under the skin of the neck. Toorop, along with the girl and her guardian nun Sister Rebeka (Michelle Yeoh), travels from the Noelite Convent in Mongolia to reach New York via Russia.\n\nThe towns and cities of Russia have been turned into dangerous, overpopulated slums by war and terrorist activity, forcing Toorop, Aurora, and Rebeka to face dangers of the human element, while fleeing from an unknown group of mercenaries claiming to have been sent by Aurora's supposedly dead father. The stress of humanity's situation causes Aurora to act out in strange ways that neither Toorop nor Rebeka can explain. On one such occasion, Aurora seems for no reason to panic and run from a crowded train station, just before it explodes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:315a02f9476f0a95e4c33b7e6aefeb6bd307da6d","amp;dn":"Babylon+A.D.+%282008%29+DVD9+PAL+ENG+GER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"315a02f9476f0a95e4c33b7e6aefeb6bd307da6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,90,2,249,71,111,10,149,228,195,59,126,106,239,235,107,211,7,218,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

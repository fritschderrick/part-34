Teaming up\nwith the legendary producer Tony Visconti, Thin\nLizzy managed to pull of a nifty trick of sounding\nleaner, tougher than they did on Johnny, yet they\nalso had a broader sonic palette. Much of this is\ndue, of course, to Visconti, who always had a\nflair for subtle dramatics that never called\nattention to themselves and he puts this to use in\ndramatic effect here, to the extent that Lizzy\nsounds stripped down to their bare bones, even\nwhen they have horns pushing them forward on\n&quot;Dancing in the Moonlight&quot; or when overdubbed\nvocals pile up on the title track. Of course, they\nwere stripped down to a trio on this record,\nlacking guitarist Brian Robertson, but Scott\nGorham's double duty makes his absence\nunnoticeable. Plus, this is pure visceral rock &amp;\nroll, the hardest and heaviest that Thin Lizzy\never made, living up to the promise of the title\ntrack. And, as always, a lot of this has to do\nwith Phil Lynott's writing, which is in top form\nwhether he's romanticizing &quot;Soldiers of Fortune&quot;\nor heading down the &quot;Opium Trail.&quot; It adds up to\nan album that rivals Jailbreak as their best\nstudio album. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nExpanded and Remastered edition w/ 6 bonus tracks.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_Lizzy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_Lizzy&lt;/a&gt;\n\nKLV is the foreign music division of KALEVALA\n\nwant us on your secure, non-rented, non-.de/.at/.ch\nsite full of nice ppl and no dickheads?\ntry to get a hold of us on irc...\n\ngreets fly out to everyone we met over the years and\nmany good grps like:\n\nBERC - GREiD - hUSHhUSH - mwnd - soup - SHELTER - FNT\nrH - GRW - DEF - BCC - DPS - AEROHOLiCS - SiNNERS\nSAiNTS - Razor1911 - gEm - ss - FiCO - WAGNER\nBLooDWeiSeR - UKi - FFNDVD - NGP - aAF\n\n.....:  - -- -------\\/--\\--_((_oX_))_--/--\\/------- -- -  :.....\n\n..:  ....:             aBHO  _ __\\/__ _   -T!             :....  :..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fee32f2434d5ba70285f556142a7548c445d5fc2","amp;dn":"Thin_Lizzy-Bad+Reputation-Remastered-2011-KLV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fee32f2434d5ba70285f556142a7548c445d5fc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,227,47,36,52,213,186,112,40,95,85,97,66,167,84,140,68,93,95,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Pearl Jam wrote and recorded Vitalogy while touring behind its previous album Vs. (1993). The music on the record was more diverse than previous releases, and consists of aggressive rock songs, ballads, and several experimental tracks.\n\nVitalogy was packaged in a booklet that replicated material from a 1920s medical book of the same name.[1] The album was first released on vinyl record, followed by a release in other formats two weeks later on December 6, 1994. Upon its CD release, Vitalogy became the second-fastest-selling album in the band's history, selling 877,000 copies in its first week. The album has been certified five times platinum by the RIAA in the United States.\n\nIn 2012, Rolling Stone magazine listed the album at #485 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\n==================================\n\nTracklist\n\n1\tLast Exit\t2:55\n2\tSpin the Black Circle\t2:48\n3\tNot for You\t5:52\n4\tTremor Christ\t4:12\n5\tNothingman\t4:35\n6\tWhipping\t2:34\n7\tPry, To\t1:03\n8\tCorduroy\t4:37\n9\tBugs\t2:45\n10\tSatan's Bed\t3:31\n11\tBetter Man\t4:26\n12\tAye Davanita\t2:58\n13\tImmortality\t5:29\n14\tHey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\t7:28\n\n======================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 1.14 GB\nPerformer                                : Pearl Jam\nGenre                                    : Rock\nRecorded date                            : 1994\n\n====================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nFormat/Info                              : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 3 366 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits\nWriting library                          : libFLAC 1.2.1 (UTC 2007-09-17)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3ae278a64ea3d9c52ea6215910c5cf085fa365e","amp;dn":"Pearl+Jam+-+Vitalogy+%281994%29+-+Flac+%7B24+Bit+96+KHz+Vinyl%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3ae278a64ea3d9c52ea6215910c5cf085fa365e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,174,39,138,100,234,61,156,82,234,98,21,145,12,92,240,133,250,54,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

CBC's 1979 rendition of the life of Louis Riel,\nand his leadership of the Metis, in the Canadian rebellion during the 1870's\nand 1880's. Made-for-TV movie, about 2 and a half hours long. There are a\ntonne of famous Canadians in this flick, it's kinda neat to see them in an\nunfamiliar setting.\n  Apparently, you will not be able to purchase this movie new ever again; my\nunderstanding is that, after it aired, a number of Canadians complained that\nit really misrepresented quite a few aspects of the people and events. I don't\nknow whether or not  a better video of this time in Canada's history has been\nmade. Probably &quot;Canada : A People's History&quot; is fairly accurate.\n  This file should recode to NTSC-compliant DVD for those so inclined.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n******************************************************************************\n                             CBC Riel (1979)\n******************************************************************************\n\n\n\nPS\nI forgot to mention, if anybody has a copy of the last episode of &quot;Man Alive&quot; (with the three devils posing as old men), I'd sure appreciate you posting it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:290c22d7580725425d429dfdf427e20d034f5a7a","amp;dn":"CBC+Riel+%281979%29+VHS-rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"290c22d7580725425d429dfdf427e20d034f5a7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,12,34,215,88,7,37,66,93,66,157,253,244,39,226,13,3,79,90,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

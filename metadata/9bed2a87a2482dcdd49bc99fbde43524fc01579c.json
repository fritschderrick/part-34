For those who work with analog RF, this book is a must-have resource. With computers and networking equipment of the 21st century running at such high frequencies, it is now crucial for digital designers to understand electromagnetic fields, radiation and transmission lines. This knowledge is necessary for maintaining signal integrity and achieving EMC compliance. Since many digital designers are lacking in analog design skills, let alone electromagnetics, an easy-to-read but informative book on electromagnetic topics should be considered a welcome addition to their professional libraries.\n\nCovers topics using conceptual explanations and over 150 lucid figures, in place of complex mathematics demystifies antennas, waveguides, and transmission line phenomenaProvides the foundation necessary to thoroughly understand signal integrity issues associated with high-speed digital design.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bed2a87a2482dcdd49bc99fbde43524fc01579c","amp;dn":"Electromagnetics+Explained++-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bed2a87a2482dcdd49bc99fbde43524fc01579c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,237,42,135,162,72,45,205,212,155,201,159,189,228,53,36,252,1,87,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

(Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in Cambridge, May 6, 1970.\n\nThe band provided entertainment during the student strike that followed Nixon's announcement of the bombing of Cambodia, the Kent State killings of students by National Guard soldiers, and other less famous protests or repressive acts by actors on both sides of the fence.\n\nThis is a monophonic soundboard recording but the sound quality is that of a very good radio broadcast. It has real punch, not dynamically flat as some two-track soundboard recordings of this band often are.\n\nRecorded from Sirius Satellite Radio's Grateful Dead channel -- in stereo this would be unlistenable due to their heavy compression, but this one sounds as good as the version I downloaded long ago from the Internet Archive (which is the same tape, seeded by David Gans who does the commentary on this broadcast).\n\nThere is lots of chatter from the band on this recording, recalling a time when they actually enjoyed (or suffered) genuine interaction with their audience. \n\nOK, enjoy and remember May 1970.\n\n2 discs, 1 hour 24 minutes\n\nTrack List\n\nDisc 1\n01 Sirius GD Channel Intro by David Gans\n02 Dancing in the Streets\n03 China Cat Sunflower + I Know You Rider\n04 Next Time You See Me\n05 Morning Dew\n\nDisc 2\n01 Good Lovin'\n02 Casey Jones\n03 St. Stephen\n04 Not Fade Away\n05 Sirius GD Channel Farewell by David Gans","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c39577a12517ae3e0cd60c19d09138f36525a50b","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+M.I.T.+Cambridge%2C+May+1970","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c39577a12517ae3e0cd60c19d09138f36525a50b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,149,119,161,37,23,174,62,12,214,12,25,208,145,56,243,101,37,165,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

But when Marvin is critically injured in an auto wreck, deranged scientist Dr. Wilder (Michael Caton) uses various animal body parts to save his life, leaving the patient with the stamina and physical skills of the organ donors. Marvin quickly gains fame as a supercop, but he's also left with all of the embarrassing animal instincts and urges that accompany his new powers -- a serious threat to his blooming romance with new girlfriend Rianna (Colleen Haskell). The Animal co-stars John C. McGinley, Edward Asner, Norm Macdonald, and Cloris Leachman.\n\nRipped with DVD Decrypter and Autogk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f44812cf0ae3336f31d6f150b2294f3818c7ba08","amp;dn":"The+Animal%282001%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f44812cf0ae3336f31d6f150b2294f3818c7ba08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,72,18,207,10,227,51,111,49,214,241,80,178,41,79,56,24,199,186,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Up four notches to number 12, 'Devil Inside' - INXS.&quot;\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nEven though Louis Armstrong (at number 33 with &quot;What A Wonderful World&quot;) died in 1971, he set a new record for longest span of time between top 40 appearances. Casey tells why.\n\nThere is a song by the first solo act in history to hit the top 10 in her teens, 20's, 30's, and 40's. Casey plays a bit a hit from each decade.\n\nOne artist in the countdown was once part of a band whose music was unmistakably diatonic, suggested the mixolydian mode, and a false modal frame. Casey explains.\n\nCherelle (at number 29 with Alexander OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Neal with &quot;Never Knew Love Like This&quot;) along with her cousin promised as children that if one of them made it in the record business, the other had to also. Her cousin has a song in this countdown.\n\nThis is the week Michael Jackson (at number 1 with &quot;Man In The Mirror&quot;) makes chart history as the first artist to get four number 1 hits from one album (from his album &quot;Bad&quot;).\n\n40:    Pamela - Toto\n39:    Hungry Eyes - Eric Carmen\n38:    Fishnet - Morris Day        \n37:    Pump Up The Volume - M/A/R/R/S/     \n36:    Love Overboard - Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips     \n35:    Going Back To Cali - L.L.

They end up in the quaint Amish community of Sugarcreek, Ohio under a set of aliases and with a broken-down old truck. Three Amish sisters running an old farmhouse inn take them under their wings and employ Micah as a handyman. This sparks the suspicions of a Sugarcreek policewoman named Rachel Troyler, niece of the three who raised her after she was orphaned as a child. Will the truth interfere with love?\n\n\nSource: DVD\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d184f7e270254a688164ae0ea0f498d827fdae0","amp;dn":"UP-Love+Finds+You+in+Sugarcreek+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d184f7e270254a688164ae0ea0f498d827fdae0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,24,79,126,39,2,84,166,136,22,74,224,234,15,73,141,130,127,218,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Terrific energy - and everything clicks\nThe &quot;no-label&quot; used the JEMS torrent for their release; in other words: it's from a lower generation source than for instance &quot;Alive In Seattle&quot; (DAC). It's taken from the master tape.\nBut this bootleg release is EQ'd, and it sounds different from the JEMS torrent because of that.

Is there a life after this one? Or do we just disappear forever? These are the questions asked in this powerful and poignant feature documentary, Infinity: The Ultimate Trip. Many may be surprised by the answers.\n\nFeaturing noted experts Gregg Braden, Dannion Brinkley, Renate Dollinger. Stanislav Grof, John Holland, Dzogchen Ponlop, Robert Thurman, Alberto Villoldo, Neale Donald Walsch and Brian Weiss, Infinity: The Ultimate Trip brings a message of hope and optimism concerning the most mysterious act in a human life; the end of this life and journey to the beyond.\n\nUsing vital and beautiful imagery, along with personal accounts of near-death experiences, reincarnation and more, Infinity brings forth the story of our own infinite nature, what to expect after death and the magic and beauty that awaits us on the other side. Here we learn of the energetic landscape of the world that we enter after we die, the angels, or beings of light, who assist us in the passing and the promise of a new life. Infinity: The Ultimate Trip is an honest and hopeful assessment of the greatest journey that any of us will ever take. It changes our view from that of dread and pessimism to one of hope, joy and light.\n\nA Film by Jay Weidner featuring Gregg Braden, Dannion Brinkley, Renate Dollinger, Stanislav Grof, John Holland, Dzogchen Ponlop, Robert Thurman, Alberto Villoldo, Neale Donald Walsch and Brian Weiss.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jayweidner.com/time.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jayweidner.com/time.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sacredmysteries.com/public/266.cfm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sacredmysteries.com/public/266.cfm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED TO PASS ON MESSAGE.

It is a discovery that could completely rewrite our understanding of our solar system and how it formed.\n\nAs the world's biggest telescopes start scanning the skies searching for Planet 9, the Sky at Night team investigates. \n\nIf Planet 9 exists, where is it and where did it come from?\n\nIn California, Chris Lintott meets the astronomers whose study of the distant Kuiper Belt led them to predict the existence of the planet. And while some scientists are still sceptical, Maggie Aderin-Pocock discovers how our models of the formation of the solar system and the discovery of similar exoplanets around other stars all support the existence of Planet 9.\n\nTechnical Spec for 720p\nVideo Codec: x265/HEVC CABAC   \nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20 (~1214Kbps)\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.48 VBR 48KHz (~126Kbps)\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 29 mins\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 279 MB\nContainer: MP4\nSource: HDTV\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:617f4d2b0a5b5e91cf6a4ad51d6a3f07d3ad9b7a","amp;dn":"Planet+9+From+Outer+Space+720p+HDTV+x265-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"617f4d2b0a5b5e91cf6a4ad51d6a3f07d3ad9b7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,127,77,43,10,91,94,145,207,106,74,213,29,106,63,7,211,173,155,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

After being used and tossed aside one too many times, she decides enough is enough. No more pretty boys. Instead, Amy begins dating Grayson .

Within days Troy is making her nuts. \n\nThings with Grayson start fizzling out and keeping Troy at armÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s length becomes impossible as someone begins to harass Amy. Harmless but obnoxious pranks soon turn violent and destructive. Troy refuses to back off and he is determined to protect her, whether she likes it or not.\n\nAmy knows she can trust Troy to keep her safe but can she trust him with her heart? \n\nGenre: Contemporary Romance\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36d08153bf35811a6d8b1f0dd7e10af4a06f0a1a","amp;dn":"Drive+Me+Crazy+%28Girl+Next+Door%29+-+Wood%2C+C.C_.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36d08153bf35811a6d8b1f0dd7e10af4a06f0a1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,208,129,83,191,53,129,26,109,139,31,13,215,225,10,244,160,111,10,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

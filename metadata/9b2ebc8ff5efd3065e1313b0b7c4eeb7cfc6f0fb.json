One of the best and most important pieces of epic poetry from human history, predating even Homer's Iliad by roughly 1,500 years, the Gilgamesh epic tells of the various adventures of that hero-king, including his quest for immortality, and an account of a great flood similar in many details to the Old Testament's story of Noah. The translator also provides an interesting and useful introduction explaining much about the historical context of the poem and the archeological discovery of th e tablets.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b2ebc8ff5efd3065e1313b0b7c4eeb7cfc6f0fb","amp;dn":"The+Epic+of+Gilgamesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b2ebc8ff5efd3065e1313b0b7c4eeb7cfc6f0fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,46,188,143,245,239,211,6,94,19,19,176,183,196,238,183,207,198,240,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

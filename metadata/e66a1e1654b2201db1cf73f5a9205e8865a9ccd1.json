Their first works had a quite romantic new-wave sound. It has radically evolved during the years with electro-dance atmospheres and/or rock-y sounds. They were joined in 1988 by Nicolas Dufaure (bass). \nThey gained a much larger audience when they signed to Lively Art and were part of the Touching Pop (pseudo musical movement they created together with Asylum Party and Mary Goes Round). Joined by Ronan Lesergent (keyboards) and Georges Remiet (guitar) in 1992, they disbanded the same year after a suprisingly common pop/rock album and a final tour. Singer Olivier Champeau is now known as Doctorolive for more techno/house sounds.\n\nThis is the re-mastered CD of three albums; Sounds In The Attic, Private Life and Past And Future.\n\n\nLabel:Infrastition Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fin 039 \nFormat:2 Ãƒâ€” CD, Compilation, Remastered \nCountry:France \nReleased:09 Feb 2009 \nGenre:Electronic, Rock \nStyle:New Wave, Darkwave \n\n\nSounds In The Attic  \n-------------------\n1.1  New Flood  4:15   \n1.2  Hillside Manor  4:11   \n1.3  Marine  3:33   \n1.4  Sandcastle  4:01   \n1.5  Johnny Got His Gun  1:43   \n1.6  A Une Passante \nLyrics By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Charles Beaudelaire*  2:34   \n1.7  The Joker  3:53   \n1.8  Fickleness  3:43   \n1.9  Fear In Colour  4:17   \n1.10  Tales Of The Wind  6:23   \n\nPrivate Life \n------------ \n1.11  Blue Years  4:23   \n1.12  A Handful Of Sand  4:52   \n1.13  My Eternal Friend  4:59   \n1.14  A Day Out Of Time  3:59   \n1.15  Precious Days  7:06   \n1.16  Berlin  5:05 \n  \n\nPast And Future  \n---------------\n2.1  A Day Out Of Time  3:49   \n2.2  A Une Passante \nLyrics By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Charles Beaudelaire*  2:31   \n2.3  Empty House  4:43   \n2.4  Old Age  3:24   \n2.5  La Ballade Des Pendus \nLyrics By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ FranÃƒÂ§ois Villon  5:44   \n2.6  Seconds  4:59   \n2.7  Alan's Waiting  3:52   \n2.8  Counter-Clock World  3:06   \n2.9  Be Seeing You  4:14   \n2.10  Future Is Now  3:54   \n2.11  Seconds - 1990 Version  4:24  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e66a1e1654b2201db1cf73f5a9205e8865a9ccd1","amp;dn":"Little+Nemo+-+Vol.+1+1987-1989+%5BFrench+Cold+Wave-Darkwave%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e66a1e1654b2201db1cf73f5a9205e8865a9ccd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,106,30,22,84,178,32,29,177,207,115,245,169,32,94,136,101,169,204,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

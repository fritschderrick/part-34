She was forced to advance his will through marriageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½her own desires always thwarted. But free-spirited Maeve will no longer endure the schemes of her latest husband, Conor, the cunning ruler of Ulster. And when her fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death puts her homeland at the mercy of its greedy lords and ConorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s forces, Maeve knows she must at last come into her own power to save it.\n\nWith secret skill and daring, Maeve proves herself the equal of any warrior on the battlefield. With intelligence and stealth, she learns the strategiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and sacrificesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½of ruling a kingdom through treacherous alliances. And to draw on the dangerous magic of her countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s oldest gods, Maeve seeks out the wandering druid Ruan, whose unexpected passion and strange connection to the worlds of spirit imperil everything Maeve thought true about herselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and put her at war with both her duty and her fate.

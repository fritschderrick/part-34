She is a 21-year-old singer songwriter from Vineland, Ontario, who recently launched her second CD Forget Me Not.\n\nGillis possesses a unique voice that can best be described as fearless Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an Ã¢â‚¬Å“originalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ musical talent in an ocean of bland and blander. She is a self-professed voracious reader with the innate ability to write songs that matter, her subjects ranging from personal despair, to creatures with healing powers, to celebrating freedom and mourning the state of the world we live in. \n\nThere have been the comparisons of her to the likes of Bob Dylan and Tom Waits, her sound is indeed rife with a traditional folk and rock beat that seems to suit her perfectly.\n\nAfter listening to Forget Me Not, Bernie Taupin (Elton JohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyricist) had this to say: Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m staggered by how good she is. There is not much that impresses me these days, but after hearing her available tracks I can honestly say sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the single most exciting thing IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve heard in a very long time.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e489875e3f48997ae9d8997ede68e8f0d310b7a","amp;dn":"Ariana+Gillis+-+Forget+Me+Not+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e489875e3f48997ae9d8997ede68e8f0d310b7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,72,152,117,227,244,137,151,174,157,137,151,237,230,142,143,13,49,11,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

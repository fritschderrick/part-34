His family is rich enough to go along with his illusion, thus a real castle, with costumed servants, becomes his place of confinement.\n\nPirandello is asking questions as to the nature of reality and illusion. I find the movie rather slow and heavy going, the true delight is the Piazzolla soundtrack written especially for it. His music was later distilled into a piece called Oblivion which is a big hit with bands and orchestras. At moments when it is absent, you'll be longing for it to come back. Devotees of Ernesto Lecuona will notice that his Tabu also appears on the soundtrack.\n\nThis is on youtube in episodes, but without subtitles.\n\nIn segmented mpg format, plays on VLC.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe02c60deabe68e146e7ac502468d02bb2be58c2","amp;dn":"Enrico+IV+%28Pirandello-Piazzolla%29+Henry+IV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe02c60deabe68e146e7ac502468d02bb2be58c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,2,198,13,234,190,104,225,70,231,172,80,36,104,208,43,178,190,88,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

His refusal to swear into the Necromonger faith has caused dissent among his subjects. Riddick strikes a deal with Commander Vaako; the location of Furya and a ship to take him there, in exchange for Vaako becoming the next Lord Marshall. Led by Vaako's aid, Krone, Riddick and a group of Necromongers arrive on a desolate planet. Recognizing it is not Furya, Riddick kills most of his escort when they attempt to assassinate him. In the chaos, Krone causes a landslide and buries Riddick alive.\n\nEmerging from the rubble with a compound tibial fracture, Riddick manages to reset and splint his broken leg and fend off native predators; including Vulture and packs of Jackal-like beasts. Needing time to heal, Riddick sequesters himself within the ruins of a long-dead civilization. Riddick then surveys a vast savanna beyond some rocky cliffs, but the only passage through is guarded by a community of poisonous, scorpion-like creatures called &quot;Mud Demons&quot; which inhabit interposing muddy pools. As he builds an immunity to the Mud Demon's venom, Riddick improvises melee weapons, while raising and training an orphaned jackal-beast pup. The two eventually succeed in defeating the local Mud Demons and reach the savannah. Riddick soon realizes a massive series of approaching storms are unleashing countless more of the Demons, who must keep their skin wet at all times to survive. With an imperative need to get off-world, Riddick activates an emergency beacon in an empty mercenary station, which broadcasts his identity and presence on the planet.\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7039ac4927fd18824f7e8e69c514e0ee6e35a612","amp;dn":"Riddick+CamRip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7039ac4927fd18824f7e8e69c514e0ee6e35a612","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,57,172,73,39,253,24,130,79,126,142,105,197,20,224,238,110,53,166,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

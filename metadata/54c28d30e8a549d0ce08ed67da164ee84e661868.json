They're still dressed in the clothes they wore to the party but their memories are fuzzy. Bob was too drunk to drive so Millie was behind the wheel and she vaguely remembers a shadow falling over them. They soon realize that everything in the town is fake. The telephone in the house isn't wired; the drawers and cupboards in the kitchen are only a facade; even the trees are fake. The town is deserted and Millie begins to wonder if they're dead. They keep hearing a child laughing and begin a search. They're not prepared for what they encounter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54c28d30e8a549d0ce08ed67da164ee84e661868","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+Stopover+In+A+Quiet+Town","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54c28d30e8a549d0ce08ed67da164ee84e661868","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,194,141,48,232,165,73,208,206,8,237,103,218,22,78,232,78,102,24,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

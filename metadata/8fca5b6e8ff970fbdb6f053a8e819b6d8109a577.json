Johnson, Michael B. Horn, &quot;Disrupting Class, Expanded Edition: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns&quot;\nISBN: 0071749101 | 2010 | EPUB\n\nClay Christensen's groundbreaking bestselling work in education now updated and expanded, including a new chapter on Christensen's seminal &quot;Jobs to Be Done&quot; theory applied to education.\n\n&quot;Provocatively titled, Disrupting Class is just what America's K-12 education system needs--a well thought-through proposal for using technology to better serve students and bring our schools into the 21st Century. Unlike so many education 'reforms,' this is not small-bore stuff. For that reason alone, it's likely to be resisted by defenders of the status quo, even though it's necessary and right for our kids. We owe it to them to make sure this book isn't merely a terrific read; it must become a blueprint for educational transformation.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Joel Klein, Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education\n\n&quot;A brilliant teacher, Christensen brings clarity to a muddled and chaotic world of education.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Jim Collins, bestselling author of Good to Great\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Just as iTunes revolutionized the music industry, technology has the potential to transform education in America so that every one of the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 50 million students receives a high quality education. Disrupting Class is a must-read, as it shows us how we can blaze that trail toward transformation.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Jeb Bush, former Governor of Florida\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fca5b6e8ff970fbdb6f053a8e819b6d8109a577","amp;dn":"Disrupting+Class%2C+%3A+How+Disruptive+Innovation+Will+Change+the+Wa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fca5b6e8ff970fbdb6f053a8e819b6d8109a577","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,202,91,110,143,249,112,251,219,111,5,58,142,129,155,109,129,9,165,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Just as remarkable is the storytelling which plays like a series of short stories and sketches rather than a novella or novel. Yet it doesn't break these short stories into segments or blocks or frame it unlike other attempts at multiple short narratives in a feature.\n\nThe movement between the various segments and stories is very poetic like from one Greek chorus to another. The central conceit being between the conflict between the war frontlines and the homefront of the village. The scenes of warfare shown in this film is harsh and brutal in a way that anticipates Roberto Rossellini's or Samuel Fuller's later films.\n\nWhat makes it even more harsh is the sense of futility in the conflict. As the infantrymen who fight each other in the trenches have more in common than either would do with their civilian countryman, anticipating Renoir's La Grande Illusion.\n\nText from the IMDB user artihcus022\n\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFile size                                : 700 MiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 36mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 016 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nDuration                                 : 1h 36mn\nBit rate                                 : 903 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 464 pixels\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 4:3\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nNominal bit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\n\nThankx to the original uploader!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d667ad74e39086ce2fc513a0ec8530643b9e5832","amp;dn":"Outskirts.Boris.Barnet.Russian.1933.DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d667ad74e39086ce2fc513a0ec8530643b9e5832","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,103,173,116,227,144,134,206,47,197,19,160,236,133,48,100,59,158,88,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

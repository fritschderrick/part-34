He's got just one mission: to find the mythical island paradise known as Far Arden, which lies hidden (so they say) in the wintry oceans of the far North. But there's more than just water standing between Shanks and his goal: he'll have to contend with circus performers, adorable orphans, heinous villains, bitter ex-lovers, well-meaning undergraduates, and the full might of the Royal Canadian Arctic Navy! Not to mention he's not so sure how to get to Far Arden in the first place... In his first solo graphic novel, Kevin Cannon (Top Ten; Bone Sharps, Cowboys, and Thunder Lizards) proves himself a master spinner of yarns with Far Arden","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c117b5675e44bc2f7ec1e96ddc8d19f9eda0b34","amp;dn":"Kevin+Cannon%3A+Far+Arden+%28Top+Shelf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c117b5675e44bc2f7ec1e96ddc8d19f9eda0b34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,17,123,86,117,228,75,194,247,236,30,150,221,200,209,159,158,218,11,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

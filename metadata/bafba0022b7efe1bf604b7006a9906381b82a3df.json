Whether theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve arrived via rocket, flying saucer, or plain old teleportation, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been invading, infiltrating, or inspiring us for decades, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve fascinated moviegoers and television watchers for more than fifty years. About half of us believe that aliens really exist, and millions are convinced theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve visited Earth.\n\nFor twenty-five years, SETI has been looking for the proof, and as the programÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s senior astronomer, Seth Shostak explains in this engrossing book, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s entirely possible that before long conclusive evidence will be found.\n\nHis informative, entertaining report offers an insiderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s view of what we might realistically expect to discover light-years away among the stars. Neither humanoids nor monsters, says Shostak; in fact, biological intelligence is probably just a precursor to machine beings, enormously advanced artificial sentients whose capabilities and accomplishments may have developed over billions of years and far exceed our own.\n\nAs he explores what, if anything, they would tell us and what their existence would portend for humankind and the cosmos, he introduces a colorful cast of characters and provides a vivid, state-of-the-art account of the past, present, and future of our search for extraterrestrial intelligence.\n\n320 pages\nPublisher: National Geographic; 1 edition (March 17, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1426203926\nISBN-13: 978-1426203923","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bafba0022b7efe1bf604b7006a9906381b82a3df","amp;dn":"+Confessions+of+an+Alien+Hunter+%282009%29+by+Seth+Shostak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bafba0022b7efe1bf604b7006a9906381b82a3df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,251,160,2,43,126,254,27,246,4,183,0,106,153,6,56,27,130,163,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

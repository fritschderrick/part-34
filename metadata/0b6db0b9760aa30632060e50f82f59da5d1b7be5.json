Dick Award and a finalist for the 2013 Kitschies Golden Tentacle (Debut Novel) Award\n\nLate in the twenty-first century, big business is booming and state institutions are thriving thanks to advances in genetic engineering, which have produced a compliant population free of addictions. Violent crime is a rarity.\n\nHyper-intelligent Jayna is a star performer at top predictive agency Mayhew McCline, where she forecasts economic and social trends. A brilliant mathematical modeler, she far outshines her co-workers, often correcting their work on the quiet. Her latest coup: finding a link between northeasterly winds and violent crime.\n\nWhen a string of events contradicts her forecasts, Jayna suspects she needs more data and better intuition. She needs direct interactions with the rest of society. BravelyÃ¢â‚¬â€and naivelyÃ¢â‚¬â€she sets out to disrupt her strict routine and stumbles unwittingly into a world where her IQ is increasingly irrelevantÃ¢â‚¬Â¦a place where human relationships and the complexity of life are difficult for her to decode. And as she experiments with taking risks, she crosses the line into corporate intrigue and disloyalty.\n\nCan Jayna confront the question of what it means to live a Ã¢â‚¬Å“normalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ life? Or has the possibility of a Ã¢â‚¬Å“normalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ life already been eclipsed for everyone?\n\nReview\n\n&quot;For readers who want a smart, subtle exploration of human emotion and intelligence, this is an excellent choice. CharnockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dystopia is actually believable. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very like our own world, but slightly stretched at the edgesÃ¢â‚¬â€corporate interests reign unchecked, the class structure is rigid, and technology has taken us well beyond the limitations of our synapses and gray matter. Charnock is a subtle worldbuilder, but a convincing one.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Strange Horizons\n\n&quot;A strong debut. Recommended.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Violin in a Void\n\n&quot;Gets the grey matter firing.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€The Taichung Bookworm \n\n&quot;Stunningly relevant re-imagining of 21st century Britain as a bioengineered corporate dystopia.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Chris Graham ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b6db0b9760aa30632060e50f82f59da5d1b7be5","amp;dn":"A+Calculated+Life+-+Anne+Charnock.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b6db0b9760aa30632060e50f82f59da5d1b7be5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,109,176,185,118,10,163,6,50,6,14,80,248,47,89,218,93,27,123,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

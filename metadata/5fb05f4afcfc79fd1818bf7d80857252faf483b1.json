Disable SmartScreen on Windows 8.\n 1. Run KMSpico_Install_v4.5.exe\n 2. Install.\n 3. Done.\n\n Based off of KMSEmulator of deagles.\n\n Thanks to deagles, mikmik38, qad, CODYQX4, xinso. All the credits for they.\n Thanks MyDigitalLife.info\n Thanks hui.\n\n Change Log:\n - Changed Server to deagles's emulator.\n - Faster.\n - Small.\n\n Note:\n - If you install a Office Retail Version after the installation of KMSpico, then run again\n the shortcut KMSpico to make the conversion, because the Service installed only activate VL.\n\n Recommendations Optional:\n\n - Disable Microsoft Security Updates.\n - Make exceptions to Directory %ProgramFiles%KMSpico in Antivirus.\n\n How This Program Works:\n\n 1. Run KMSELDI.exe\n 1.1. Check Products Installed.\n 1.2. Convert Retail to VL if it is necessary.\n 1.3. If it found a non-permanent product it will converted. (hacktivators based in modified dll's ARE NOT PERMANENT) (MAK or OEM keys are the only ones PERMANENT)\n 1.4. Create a random service kms emulator in memory.\n 1.5. Activate for 180 days all VL products installed against the emulator.\n 1.6. Close emulator and KMSELDI.\n 2. Install Service KMSELDI\n 2.1. Every windows start or every 24 hours the service reactivate for 180 days (reset the count) with a random kms emulator.\n 2.2. Close emulator.\n 3. KMSELDI + Service KMSELDI = &quot;permanent&quot;.

It is the\nband's third studio album and the first to feature new drummer Isaac\nCarpenter. The album features 11 new songs, which continue the band's\ntrademark blend of hard rock with a punk edginess that makes them\ninstantly identifiable. The songs were written over a period of time in\nlate 2009 / early 2010 and the band went into the studio in August 2010\nwith renowned rock producer Terry Date (Slipknot, Pantera etc). The\nresult is Loaded's most accomplished and most hard hitting album to\ndate.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nSupport the artists! We did.\n\nQuestions? Comments?

Like his dad, the late Chicago guitar hero Luther Allison, Bernard likes to mix his music with rock and soul. This CD starts with a burst of uptempo funk (&quot;The River's Rising&quot;) and quickly passes through six-string metallurgy (&quot;I Just Came Back to Say Goodbye,&quot; with it's ZZ Top rhythmic bedrock and squealing guitar), Johnny Taylor-style ballads (like the Malaco-perfect &quot;Work It Out&quot;), and other permutations. Although Allison's voice possesses a serviceable simplicity, it's his guitar that really sings, chorus after chorus packed with keening wah-wah and daredevil bends. It's also full of down-to-the-bone blues runs, like the solo that tags the funky &quot;Higher Love.&quot; Allison shows some Texas sting, too, especially on a Stevie Ray-style guitar epic called &quot;I've Been Down,&quot; which should produce fireworks live. - amazon.com\n\nBitrate:320@mp3\n\n\n01.

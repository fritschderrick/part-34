You can also switch to a full screen mode, zoom in or out, and merge the maps to BMP file format.\n\nDuring our testing we have noticed that the tool carries out a task very quickly, provides very good image quality, and no errors showed up throughout the entire process. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t put a lot of stress on CPU and memory, so the overall system performance is not hampered.\n\nAll in all, Offline Map Maker provides an intuitive layout and a handy set of parameters for helping you download maps with ease.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7983845a82743139dcf1b082a4aaa77e9ac66e9d","amp;dn":"Education+Software+%3A+Offline+Map+Maker+v5.02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7983845a82743139dcf1b082a4aaa77e9ac66e9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,131,132,90,130,116,49,57,220,241,176,130,164,170,167,126,154,198,110,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

Eleven million caravan nights bring around 300 million pounds  \n  to the Welsh economy every year and this series gets to know some of  \n  the people spending their leisure time in their own fibre glass box.  \n  We explore the joys of hitching your home to the back of the car and  \n  hitting the open road or settling down in a static on one of Wales's  \n  many coastline sites.                                                 \n                                                                        \n  Vince Owen from the Rhondda is leading South Wales Caravan Club's     \n  attempt to win the biggest award in Touring caravanning - the         \n  Inter-Centre Cup at the National Rally. This year the club will also  \n  be hosting the huge event in Laleston, Bridgend. Will the host team   \n  organise a successful weekend - and more to the point can they carry  \n  home the cup? Eileen from Pontypridd knows her way around a netball   \n  court but how highly does she score in the kitchen? The tug-of-war    \n  team have spent all summer training but can they beat their arch      \n  rivals from West Wales? And all the club's hopes rest on single mum   \n  Angela as she takes on the best, in the caravan reversing             \n  competition.                                                          \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6b1c5f0d08190e1c2b0c060a020745080406&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a2d3c52bd4a21d4a3e43b4bab24b1994bff3f48","amp;dn":"Wales.on.Wheels.S01E03.WEBRip.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a2d3c52bd4a21d4a3e43b4bab24b1994bff3f48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,45,60,82,189,74,33,212,163,228,59,75,171,36,177,153,75,255,63,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

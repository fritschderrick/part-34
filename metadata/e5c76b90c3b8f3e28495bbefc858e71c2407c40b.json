The muscles of\nyour lower torso make it possible for you to stand upright, shift your bodyweight, bend, twist, walk, and move in any direction. Remember the\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“playing chessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ example? You use your core to maintain your posture in a chair and as the base to lift your arm to move the pieces. Needless to\nsay, a healthy and strong core is extremely important to your ability to perform any action.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5c76b90c3b8f3e28495bbefc858e71c2407c40b","amp;dn":"7+Weeks+to+300+Sit-Ups+%5BLordwise%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5c76b90c3b8f3e28495bbefc858e71c2407c40b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,199,107,144,195,184,243,226,132,149,187,239,200,88,231,28,36,7,196,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

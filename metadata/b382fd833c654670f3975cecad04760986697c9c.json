With his deep, resonant baritone and spare percussive guitar, he had a basic, distinctive sound. Cash didn't sound like Nashville, nor did he sound like honky tonk or rock &amp; roll. He created his own subgenre, falling halfway between the blunt emotional honesty of folk, the rebelliousness of rock &amp; roll, and the world-weariness of country. Cash's career coincided with the birth of rock &amp; roll, and his rebellious attitude and simple, direct musical attack shared a lot of similarities with rock. However, there was a deep sense of history -- as he would later illustrate with his series of historical albums -- that kept him forever tied with country. And he was one of country music's biggest stars of the '50s and '60s, scoring well over 100 hit singles. \n\nArtist...............: Johnny Cash\nAlbum................: Life Unheard\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD {Columbia/Legacy/Sony #88883729352}\nYear.................: 2013\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 47 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: NMR\nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 3/22/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: NFO, MD5, CUE, AUDIOCHECKER\nCovers...............: Front Back CD \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.

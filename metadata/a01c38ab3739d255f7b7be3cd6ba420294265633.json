Edie has no intention of swapping her nurse's uniform for a cocktail dress - not when her newborn infant needs her. But if she and Asher - her shapeshifter fiancÃƒÂ© - can't figure out a way to bleed Raven's power, they may never get out of this plasma-soaked pleasure palace...undead or alive.\n\n\nApparently, this may be the last in the series.....?\n\n\n\nIn both .epub and .mobi formats.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a01c38ab3739d255f7b7be3cd6ba420294265633","amp;dn":"Cassie+Alexander+-+Edie+Spence+%2305","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a01c38ab3739d255f7b7be3cd6ba420294265633","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,28,56,171,55,57,210,85,247,183,190,60,214,186,66,2,148,38,86,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

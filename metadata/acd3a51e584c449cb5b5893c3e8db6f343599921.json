Individual States were established and navigating to other areas of the Solar system required a few hundred years. Contact with other countries was virtually impossible.\n\nSoon the Eris Empire noted the strange stars that existed in the space region. As their Research advanced, they discovered that these stars can move instantly from one area to another area.\n\nLabeling it the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Warp GateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ This allowed many stars systems that had been isolated to make first contact with each other and so began the Age of Discovery.\n\nThrough Aggression and conquest, Repeated Destruction and Submission, the Nations began to build civilizations from one star to the next.\n\nThe Ã¢â‚¬Å“Star field network DiagramÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ? Became the New World Map.\n\nIn 939 AD Space unity.\n\nNations asked why the leaders of the three powers are seeking power...\n\nThe National Eris Empire Council is the worlds largest empire able to restore the world order and suppress chaos.\n\nImperial Japan was the world's oldest nation, and worn out during the prolonged war with the Chinese empire, it is the largest one being targeted.\n\n\n\n\nTo play this game use a program such as Deamon Tools to mount the files, install them on your computer then do the V1.02Update and the do the english patch(it's not a full patch, though it's the most complete one.\n\nThe game is in Japanese so you might need AppLoc or have your computer set on Japanese local for it to install(it might still work without any of these).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acd3a51e584c449cb5b5893c3e8db6f343599921","amp;dn":"Daiteikoku+%5B18%2B+H+Game%5D+With+English+patch+V0.35+and+V1.02Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acd3a51e584c449cb5b5893c3e8db6f343599921","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,211,165,30,88,76,68,156,181,181,137,60,62,141,182,243,67,89,153,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}

The film focuses on the torrid and manipulative relationships among three characters. As the story progresses, each of their secrets, lies and hidden agendas are exposed. Themes of seduction, deception, exploitation and control shift and accelerate to a delerious climax. \n\nOriginally called [b]11 Days with Ivan[/b], the film was cut down from its 2 hour 10 minute running time to a brisk 75 minutes, effectively cutting 4 days out of the original. The result: a faster-paced narrative and a riveting character study. \n\nSynopsis: Al, a sensitive, reclusive Canadian Artist living in a remote cottage, is visited by Ivan, a boisterous, erratic, ambitious American friend from college, accompanied by his new wife, Sienna, a beautiful and mysterious woman.

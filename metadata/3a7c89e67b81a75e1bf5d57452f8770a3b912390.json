It was initially banned in many states compelling a theatrically presented 'toned-down' version. Censorship revolved mostly around young Tina Louise's excessively healthy boobs.\n\nThe most consistent supporting actor ever; Robert Ryan, holds the charm with some interesting inclusions in the cast. Aldo Ray plays inflexible in-law Bill, who can't accept that the local plant has shut down... once '50s pinup, Fay Spain plays the unwed nubile sister... Buddy Hackett of 'Buddy Hackett' fame plays the candidate for local Sheriff and &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; 's Michael Landon portrays the kidnapped albino worker (didn't you know - &quot;they're good luck!&quot;). All in all this is just too good a film to be so forgotten. It resonates feelings of isolation, bigotry, self-importance, small town lust, and warping materialism. With Mann steering the ship this is racy comedy that plays as a sanctinfy'in fable. You gotta see this...\n\n\n\n\n-------------not my rip-----------\n\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: God's Little Acre Uncensored.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,450,721,348 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:57:53\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.2 Final\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x384 (AR: 1.875)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1499 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.217 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1 \n\n*****************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.

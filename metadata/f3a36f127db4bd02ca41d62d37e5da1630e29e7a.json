Breakthroughs have come from studying a remarkable woman in London who has felt no pain at all in her life, a man in the US who cut off his own arm to survive, and three generations of an Italian family who don't feel extremes of temperature.\nWe witness a new treatment that involves a pioneering computer game 'snow world' that contains the power to banish pain. And we find how powerfully our moods and emotions shape what pain we feel.\n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.74 GB\nSource: DVB-S (BBCHD)\nRipped by JungleBoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3a36f127db4bd02ca41d62d37e5da1630e29e7a","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+The+Secret+World+of+Pain+2011+720p+HDTV+x264+AC3-MVG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3a36f127db4bd02ca41d62d37e5da1630e29e7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,163,111,18,125,180,189,2,202,65,214,45,55,229,218,22,48,226,158,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
